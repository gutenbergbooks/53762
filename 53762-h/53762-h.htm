<h2>THE SECOND BATTLE OF THE SOMME.</h2>
</div>

<p>At different periods during the War, important events took place
in the Plains of Picardy, in the region which extends between Amiens
and St. Quentin, Bapaume and Noyon, between the valleys of the
rivers Ancre, Avre and Oise.</p>

<p>The Franco-British Offensive of July-September 1916, and the
German Retreat of March 1917, are described in the Michelin Guide
"<b>The First Battle of the Somme</b>, 1916-1917", which includes carefully
prepared itineraries, enabling the reader to cover the whole battlefield
of that period.</p>

<p>The present guide describes the operations which took place in
Picardy in March-April 1918 (<b>The German Offensive</b>), and in
August 1918 (<b>The Franco-British Offensive</b>); in a Word, the ebb
and flow of the German Armies in 1918, from St. Quentin to Montdidier.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3>THE BATTLEFIELD.</h3>

<p>Driven from the banks of the Somme by the Franco-British Offensive
of 1916, the Germans were compelled, in March 1917, to retreat,
before the menace of the Allied offensives on their flank.</p>

<p>They then established themselves on the Hindenburg Line, and in
1917, in consequence of British attacks in the Arras sector and before
Cambrai, they unceasingly increased the number of their fortified
lines. This redoubtable position stretched to the west of the Cambrai-La
Fère road, via Le Catelet and St. Quentin, utilising a series
of natural obstacles, the most important of which were the Escaut,
the St. Quentin Canal and the marshy valley of the Oise. (See the
Michelin Guide "<b>The Hindenburg Line</b>".)</p>

<p>But in the early days of 1918, having crushed Russia, Germany
decided to assume the offensive, using the Hindenburg positions as
a kind of spring-board, from which her mighty armies rushed forward
to conquer France.</p>

<p>In February 1918, the British positions extended in front of the
Hindenburg Line, as far as the village of Barisis, opposite the Forest of
St. Gobain, to the south of the Oise. Three successive positions,
widely separated from one another, had been actively strengthened.
Moreover, the water-lines of the marshy valley of the Oise, the Crozat
Canal, the loop in the Somme, and the North Canal, formed so many
natural obstacles.</p>

<p>The Picardian Plain, with its broad and gentle undulations, dotted
here and there with small woods, is closed, on the south, near the valley
of the Oise, by the wooded hills of Genlis, Frières and La Cave, and to
the west of the bend in the Oise, by the hills of Porquericourt and
the wooded <i>massif</i> of Le Plémont, with its promontory, Mount Renaud,
to the south of Noyon. Further west, the high ground of Boulogne-la-Grasse
does not close the Plain of Santerre, which, between the
slopes of Le Plémont and Montdidier, communicates freely with the
Plain of Ile-de-France. The enclosed and wooded valleys of the rivers
Avre, Trois-Doms and Luce intersect the tablelands of Santerre.
Further north, stretches the old battlefield of 1916,&mdash;a chaotic waste
of winding trenches and barbed wire entanglements.</p>

<p>In the Picardian Plain, beyond the bounds of the old battlefield,
were numerous country villages, with their cottages grouped around
the church. The long, straight roads, bordered with fine elms or
fruit-trees, stretched as far as the eye could reach. This rich and
prosperous region, with its vast fields of corn and beet, was completely
ravaged by the War.</p>

<p class="center"><b>The Opposing Forces&mdash;Their Material and Moral Strength.</b></p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Towards the end of 1917, the abandonment of the Allies, by Russia,
was consummated by the Russo-German Armistice of December 20,
followed by the Peace of Brest-Litowsk, of February 9, 1918. As
early as November 1917, Germany began to transfer her legions from
the eastern to the western front. Arriving, via Belgium, in ever-increasing
numbers, sixty-four new divisions were thus added to her
Western Armies, already one hundred and forty-one divisions strong,
giving a total strength of 205 German divisions against the Allies'
177 divisions.</p>

<p>The material resources, accumulated on the Russian front, were
likewise transferred to the western front. The enemy's artillery was
reinforced all along the line, the number of heavy batteries being
doubled in many of the sectors.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ludendorff.</span><br /></div>
<i>From General Buat's</i> "<span class="smcap">Ludendorff</span>" (<cite>Publishers: Payot. Paris.</cite>)
</div>

<p>Besides this numerical and material superiority, Germany possessed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

the additional advantage of a unique commander: Ludendorff, master
of the hour, at once absolute military chief and political dictator.
On the other hand, whilst the Allies were closely united by cordial
friendship, sealed on the field of battle, their armies were independant
units, separately commanded, each having its own reserves concentrated
behind its particular front.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">General Pétain among his "poilus"</span></div>
</div>

<p>On February 3, 1917, the United States of America ranged themselves
on the side of the Allies, but their eventually powerful effort
could not make itself seriously felt before the summer of 1918. In
March 1918, four American divisions were in France, and a million
more men were expected by the following Autumn, but the Germans
were convinced that they would have the Allies beaten before then.</p>

<p>The moral strength of the opposing forces constituted one of the
most important factors of victory.</p>

<p>During 1917, after the Allies' Spring Offensives, a wave of lassitude
had lowered the fighting spirit of certain units of the French Army.
However, the <em>morale</em> of the French Army had fully regained its former
high level, when the great German offensive of March 1918 was
launched.</p>

<p>The British Army had in the meantime perfected its training, and
acquired, in addition to experience, splendid fighting qualities.</p>

<p>The Germans, badly shaken in 1916 by their failure at Verdun and
by the Allies' Offensive on the Somme, had, in consequence of Russia's
collapse, recovered all their former arrogant confidence and pride.</p>

<p>But the Allies' blockade, despite Germany's ruthless submarine
warfare, tightened, and each day the menace of famine increased.</p>

<p>Triumphal announcements of victory, and promises of an early
German peace appeared periodically in their press, yet still the war
dragged on. Something had to be done to end it all, whatever the
cost, and so the "Peace Offensive" was decided on.</p>

<p>Although inferior in numbers and equipment, the Allies had acquired
moral superiority.</p>

<h3> The German Strategy and Tactics.</h3>

<p>In all the previous offensives, especially that of the Somme in 1916,
the artillery had been used, prior to the attack, to destroy the
adversary's defences. The great number of fortified works and their
ever increasing strength necessitated a proportionately longer and more
intense artillery preparation. Thus warned, the enemy were able to make
dispositions to counteract the effects of the attack, and to bring up
reinforcements.</p>

<p>Moreover, the tremendous pounding of the ground greatly hampered
the advance of the storming troops, who were hindered at every
step by the enormous shell-holes and craters.</p>

<p>Breaking away from past errors, and adopting and perfecting the
methods inaugurated the previous year before Riga, the German
High Command attacked by surprise, in March 1918, thereby securing
a crushing numerical superiority. The Allies were thrown into confusion,
and all attempts at resistance were unavailing, until the arrival
of the reserves. During this period of complete demoralisation, the
enemy were able to exploit their initial success to the full.</p>

<p>The method employed was that of a sudden, violent shock, preceded
by a short artillery preparation, mostly with smoke and gas shells,
the aim of which was to put the men out of action, rather than to
crush the defences. To this end, huge concentrations of troops were
effected, in such wise that the masses of men could be thrown quickly
and secretly at the presumed weak part of the Allies' front.</p>

<p>The semi-circular disposition of the front facilitated the enemy's
task, as the German reserves, grouped in the Hirson-Mézières region,
in the centre of the semi-circle, could be used with the same rapidity
against any part of the front-line from Flanders to Champagne.</p>

<p>The point chosen by Ludendorff was the junction of the Franco-British
Armies. To separate these two groups, by driving back
the British, on the right, and the French, on the left; to exploit
the initial success in the direction of the sea, isolating the British
and forcing them back upon their naval bases of Calais and Dunkirk;
then, having crushed the British, to concentrate the whole of his
efforts against the French, who, unsupported and demoralized, would
soon be driven to their knees,&mdash;such was apparently the strategical
conception of the enemy's "Kaiserschlacht" or "Emperor's Battle".</p>

<p>On March 21, three German armies attacked along a 54-mile front,
from the Scarpe to the Oise.</p>

<p>In the north, the XVIIth Army (von Below) and the IInd Army
(von Marwitz) attacked on either side of the Cambrai salient, but the
main effort was made by the XVIIIth Army (von Hutier), which stretched
from the north of St. Quentin to the Oise.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_009.jpg" alt="Map of German Attacks." />
</div>

<p>Facing these armies were: the right of the British 3rd Army (Byng),
extending from the Scarpe to Gouzeaucourt, and the British 5th. Army
(Gough), from Gouzeaucourt to south of the Oise.</p>

<p>The British expected the brunt of the attack to fall between the
river Sensée and the Bapaume-Cambrai road, i.e. on the right of Byng's
Army, which was reinforced accordingly, whilst the sector in front of
the Oise, south of St. Quentin, against which von Hutier's huge army
had been concentrated, was only held by 4 divisions.</p>

<p>More than 500,000 Germans were about to attack the 160,000 British
under Gough and Byng, whilst from the outset of the battle, large enemy
reserves swelled the number of the attacking divisions to 64, i.e.,
more than the total number of British divisions in France. In all, no
less than 1,150,000 Germans were engaged in these tremendous onslaughts.</p>

<p>During the five nights which preceded the attack, the German
divisions had been brought up secretly, the artillery having previously
taken up its positions and corrected its range, without augmenting
the volume of firing, so that nothing revealed the increased number
of the batteries.</p>

<p>The shock troops, after several weeks of intensive training,
were brought up by night marches to the points of attack. During
the day, they were kept out of sight in the woods or villages. At
night, whether on the march or bivouacking, lights and fires were
strictly forbidden. Aeroplanes hovered above the columns to see
that these orders were carried out. The ammunition parks and
convoys were concealed in the woods. Until the last moment, the
troops and most of the officers were kept in ignorance of their
destination.</p>

<p>These huge forces moving silently under the cover of night, symbolized
the enemy's might and cunning. "<em>It is strange</em>", wrote a German
officer in his note-book, "<em>to think of these huge masses of troops&mdash;all
Germany on the march&mdash;moving westward to-night</em>".</p>

<h2>THE BATTLE.</h2>
</div>

<p>On March 21, during this, the "Einbruch" or piercing stage, the
enormous enemy mass crushed, in less than 48 hours, the three
British positions situated in front of St. Quentin. Carrying the battle
into the open country beyond, the enemy transformed the "piercing"
into a break-through ("Durchbruch").</p>

<p>This sudden, powerful thrust was followed by a "tidal wave" of
German infantry which at first submerged all before it, but which,
dammed by degrees, finally spent itself, a week later, against the Allies'
new front.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3>THE DISRUPTION OF THE BRITISH FRONT.</h3>

<p>On March 21, at daybreak (4.40 a.m.) a violent cannonade broke
out, and for five hours the intensity of this drum-fire steadily increased.</p>

<p>First, a deluge of shells, mostly gas, pounded the British
batteries, some of which were silenced. Then the bombardment ploughed
up the first positions, spreading dense clouds of gas and fumes over a
wide zone.
</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="center"><b>"Michael" hour.</b></p>

<p>Under cover of the smoke and fog, the German Infantry speedily
crossed No-Man's Land, and at 9.30 a.m. ("Michael" hour) penetrated
the British defences.</p>

</div>

<p>The front assigned to each attacking division was only two
kilometres wide, the troops being formed into two storm columns of
one regiment each. The third regiment was kept as sector reserves, to
develop initial successes.</p>

<p>The storm-troops, led by large numbers of non-commissioned officers,
advanced in waves, shoulder-to-shoulder, preceded by a rolling barrage
some 300 yards ahead of the first line. This barrage afterwards moved
forward at the rate of about 200 yards every five minutes.</p>

<p>The waves advanced resolutely, protected first by the rolling
barrage, then by the accompanying artillery and <i>Minenwerfer</i>.
Wherever the resistance was too strong, a halt was made, allowing the
neighbouring waves to outflank the obstacle on either side, and crush
it.</p>

<p>The Germans straightway threw the greatest possible mass of
infantry into the Allies' defences.</p>

<p>Amid clouds of gas, smoke and fog, the British in the advanced

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>

positions were surrounded and overwhelmed, often before they had
realized what was happening.</p>

<p>Nearly all their machine-guns, posted to sweep the first zone, were
put out of action.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="center"><b>The First Day (March 21).</b></p>

<p>The first day of the attack, General Byng's Army from
Fontaine-les-Croisilles to Demicourt, withstood the shock steadily, the
Germans penetrating the first lines only.</p>

<p>In the centre, before St. Quentin, and to the south, in front
of Moy and La Fère, General Gough's Army, overwhelmed by numbers,
and notwithstanding the courage of the men, was broken early in the
attack.</p>

<p>Opposite Le Catelet, the enemy storm divisions advanced 6 to 8
kilometres, penetrating at noon the second-line positions along the
Epéhy-Le Verguier line. Further south, in front of Moy, they reached
Essigny-Fargnières.</p>

<p>General Gough withdrew his right behind the water-line of the Crozat
and Somme Canals.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="center"><b>The Second Day&mdash;March 22.</b><br /></p>

<p>Tergnier fell, and the water-line was turned from the right. Still
favoured by the fog, the Germans crossed the Crozat Canal. Fresh
divisions harassed the British without respite, the losses, both in men
and material, being very heavy.</p>

<p>Their reserves, greatly outnumbered, were quickly submerged, and
the third positions were lost after a desperate but ineffectual
resistance.</p>

<p>In spite of its stubborn resistance, the 3rd Army (Byng) was forced
to fall back, pivoting on its left, to line up with the retreating 5th
Army (Gough).</p>

<p>The enemy advance developed rapidly. Within forty-eight hours,
over 60 German divisions (750,000 men) had been thrown into the
battle, which now raged in the open.</p>

<h3>THE INTERVENTION OF THE FRENCH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_012.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Phases of the French Intervention.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The crushing of the right and centre of the British 5th Army opened
a large breach north of the Oise, through which, as early as March 21,
the Germans streamed south and west. The situation was critical, as the
enemy hordes, having broken through the fortified zone, threatened to
submerge all before them. Prompt intervention was imperative, in order
to retard the enemy at all cost.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">General Pellé reviewing the troops of the<br />
5th Corps in 1917.</span></div>
</div>

<p>As early as the evening of the 21st, General Pétain made
dispositions to support the British right. The 9th and 10th Div. (5th
Corps) and the 1st Div. of unmounted Cuirassiers (Pellé), in reserve
near Compiègne, received orders to hold themselves in readiness.
At the same time, the staff of Gen. Fayolle's Army Group, and that
of Gen. Humbert's Army, prepared to take over the direction of the
operations.</p>

<p>The 125th Inf. Div. was pushed forward to the Oise, whilst the
22nd, 62nd, and 1st. Cavalry. Divn. (Robillot's Group) were rapidly
despatched to the weak points of the battle line.</p>

<p>This newly formed group was placed under the command of Gen.
Robillot of the 2nd Cavalry Corps.</p>

<p>Rushed up in lorries, the first French divisions were thrown into
the thick of the battle without waiting for their artillery. Heroism
often made good the lack of equipment and munitions.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF DISRUPTION.</h3>

<p>Once the fortified zone crossed, the German armies pushed westward
rapidly.</p>

<p>On March 23, the French Cavalry Divisions were engaged, with their
armoured cars and groups of cyclists. Thanks to their great mobility,
the situation was repeatedly saved. Galloping from breach to breach,
the Cavalry, dismounting, stayed the enemy advance until the arrival
of the infantry.</p>

<p>The armoured cars raided the enemy's lines unceasingly and harassed
their troops with machine-gun fire. They were also used for bringing
up supplies to the first-line troops and for maintaining the different
liaisons. Their splendid work, with that of the Cyclist Corps, greatly
helped to stay the enemy thrust.</p>

<p>The retreat of the British was also covered by detachments of
cavalry, mounted artillery, armoured cars and tanks, which vigorously
attacked the assaillants.</p>

<p>The Air Service likewise rendered invaluable aid.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 22nd, General Pétain gave orders for every
available bombing plane to be used to retard the enemy advance, until
reinforcements could be brought up. The air squadrons met a few
hours later at the assigned point, some of them having flown ninety
miles. On the way, they dropped their loads of bombs on German
troops which were crossing the Somme, north of Ham, thereby retarding
the advance of two enemy divisions which were preparing to outflank
the British.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, at noon, a hundred aeroplanes, skimming just over the
Germans' heads, wrought indescribable havoc and confusion in their
ranks. Priceless hours were thus gained.</p>

<h3>Crossing the Water-line of the<br />
Crozat Canal, Somme and Tortille (March 23-24).</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_014-1.jpg" alt="Map." />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>Whilst Byng's Army withstood the enemy's onslaughts, that commanded
by Gough was dislocated by the powerful thrust of von Hutier's Army.</p>

<p>On the <b>morning of the 23rd</b>, the remnants of the British 3rd
and 18th Corps were thrown back across the Crozat Canal, among the
French divisions which were taking part in the battle between the Somme
and Oise, and with which they were assimilated.</p>

<p>Further north, his divisions heavily depleted, and reinforcements
coming up only slowly, General Gough abandoned the strong
Somme-Tortille line, and continued his retreat westward, towards his
reserves in the old battlefield of 1916.</p>

<p>The same day, the first French units to arrive were thrown between
Crozat Canal and the woods of Genlis and Frières, linking up, on their
right, with the 125th Division, detached from the left of the 6th
Army, and established astride of the Oise, in front of Viry. (<i>Sketch
below</i>).</p>

<p>The 1st Division of dismounted Cuirassiers (Brécart) vigorously attacked
the enemy, and succeeded in staying their thrust towards the Oise. The
9th Division (Gamelin) barred the Ham-Noyon road, along a ten mile front.
On their left, the 10th Division (Valdant) held the zone north of Guiscard.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><i>The French Divisions were engaged from the Oise to<br />

</div>

<p>On the evening of the 23rd, the situation was critical. General
Pellé's divisions retarded the German advance in front of the Chauny-Noyon
region, which they were covering, but the enemy held Ham.
In their retreat, the British constantly bore to the north-west.</p>

<p>The 1st Cavalry Division (Rascas), and the 22nd (Capdepont) and
62nd (Margot) Divisions arrived, and were thrown into the battle between
Guiscard and Nesle, where they attempted to join hands with the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

French 10th Division on their right and with the British on their left.</p>

<div class="caption"><i>Converging on Noyon, the Germans effected a breach<br />

</div>

<p>The same day, the German long range "Bertha" guns began to
bombard Paris, in the hope of spreading panic and disorder there.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">General Humbert.</span></div>
</div>

<p>On <b>March 24</b>, the crushing effect of the German thrust was
further accentuated by the arrival of new enemy divisions.</p>

<p>Favoured by the fog, which entirely hid the valleys of the Oise and
Somme, their advance-guards swept the plain with machine-gun fire, in
their search for gaps and weak places in the thin French line.</p>

<p>All the attacks converged towards Noyon. At 9 a.m., in the valley
of the Oise, the capture of Viry-Noureuil threatened Chauny, whilst in
the centre, Villequier-Aumont and Genlis Wood were taken. Overwhelmed
by numbers, the Cuirassiers, after firing their last cartridges, fell
back on Caillouel Hill. The divisions on the left took up positions
south of Guiscard. In spite of the unequal struggle, the fighting
spirit of the troops remained admirable.</p>

<p>On the left of General Pellé's group, between Nesle and Guiscard,
the situation was still more desperate, as, having crossed the Somme,
the Germans now greatly intensified their thrust. The depleted British
units continued their retreat westward, leaving a gap north of Nesle.
The French 22nd Div. was hurriedly despatched towards Nesle, and
elements of the 1st Cav. Div. to the east of Chaulnes.</p>

<p>On March 24, south of Péronne, the German IInd Army crossed with
difficulty the marshy valley of the Somme, then pushing on towards
Chaulnes, opened a gap at Pargny.</p>

<p>North of Péronne, the enemy reached Sailly-Saillisel, Rancourt and
Cléry in the morning, and pushed west with 3,000 cavalry. In danger of
being turned, Byng's Army, which had abandoned the Havrincourt Salient
during the night of the 22nd, evacuated Bertincourt and retreated
westward.</p>

<p><i>One of the gravest consequences of the retreat of Gough's Army was

consolidate the liaison was the constant aim of the French General
Staff.</i></p>

<p><i>These units coolly withdrew, whenever they found themselves outflanked
and in danger of being cut off, often fighting furious rearguard
actions, and repulsing the enemy with heavy loss, each time a frontal
attack was attempted. (Field-Marshal Haig).</i></p>

<p>On the contrary, we read in Ludendorff's Memoirs that <i>the German
XVIIth Army was exhausted, having suffered too heavy losses before the
Cambrai Salient on March 21 and 22</i>.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>During the night, the enemy continued to press forward in the fog,
in an attempt to rout the precariously installed and ill-supplied
French units, and to harass Gough's Army, in retreat towards the
Santerre Plateau. On this, Palm Sunday evening, Holy Week opened
tragically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Fall of Noyon and the Fighting on<br />
the old Battlefield of the Somme.</h3>

<p><b>The 25th, at daybreak</b>, fresh German divisions violently attacked
the exhausted French units, seeking to turn their left wing, and at the
same time crush General Pellé's group in the centre.</p>

<p>In face of the increasing danger, General Pellé received orders to
"check the enemy advance, whatever the condition of the men might be".</p>

<p>The 1st Inf. Div. (Grégoire), hastily brought up and reinforced by
the remnants of the British 18th Div. and of various French Divisions
picked up on the way, established itself on the hills which cover Noyon
to the north-east. They had scarcely taken up their positions, when
the Germans attacked, only to be repulsed. Further to the left, the
enemy were unable to debouch from Crisolles, but on the French right,
the 55th and 125th Div., which had been fighting incessantly since the
22nd, were forced back across the Oise, near Brétigny. Pushing on, the
Germans captured Bab&#339;uf, but a British counter-attack forced them
to fall back slightly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_017-1.jpg" alt="Map." />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>The battle continued to rage and the danger of being outflanked
became more and more acute. Catigny and Beaurains fell, leaving
Noyon unprotected on the north-west. In the course of a fierce
counter-attack, the 144th Inf. Reg. succeeded in recapturing these
villages, but the German hordes still pressed on, opening a gap
between Beaurains and Genvry, through which they poured, following the
little valley of the Verse which slopes down towards Noyon. The troops
defending the northern and north-eastern approaches to that town were
now threatened with being surrounded.</p>

<p>General Pellé endeavoured to stop this fresh gap with the few
units left at his disposal, and organized a new line of support on
Porquericourt Hill and Mont Renaud (<i>sketch, p. 18</i>), at the same time
urging the troops which were fighting to the north of Noyon to "hold
out a few hours longer, each hour being worth a day".</p>

<p>One French division, and units of a second division, comprising some
British remnants, were now fighting against odds of four to one.</p>

</div>

<p>On the <b>evening of the 25th</b>, they fell back in good order, on
Noyon. The 57th Inf. Reg. resisted all night in the town, to enable the
final line of resistance to be organized.</p>

<p>At midnight, the front line passed in front of Porquericourt Hill
and Mont Renaud, at Pont-l'Évêque, thence following the Oise. It was
along this line that Gen. Pellé's Corps had orders to hold the German
advance, and bar the road to Paris.</p>

<p>General Humbert declared on the evening of the 25th: <i>The troops of
the 5th A.C. and of the 2nd C. of unmounted Cavalry are defending the
very heart of France. The consciousness of the grandeur of their task
will point out the path of duty to them.</i></p>

<p>This day (25th) was still more tragical on General Humbert's left.
At daybreak, a violent battle broke out around Nesle, the town being
abandoned at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>Spread over a too wide front, from Nesle to Guiscard, the troops under
Gen. Robillot had orders to maintain the liaison on their right with
Gen. Pellé's forces (retreating southward) and on the left with the
depleted British units which were falling back to the north-west. The
gap widened, and the enemy pressed through. The situation was highly
critical, the road to Montdidier being now open.</p>

<span class="smcap">The road to Amiens open to the enemy.</span></div>
</div>

<p>South of the Somme, the situation was still more critical. The
remains of the British 18th and 19th Corps withdrew to the line
Chaulnes-Frise, which they were, however, unable to hold.</p>

<p>Their retreat continued to the line Proyart-Rosières. No more
reserves were expected for four days. Should the Germans succeed in
crushing these exhausted units the road to Amiens would be open.</p>

<p>About six miles behind the Proyart-Rosières front, there was an old
French line, partly filled in, on the Santerre Plateau, between the
Somme (at Sailly-le-Sec) and the Luce (at Demuin).</p>

<p>A battalion of Canadian Engineers was ordered to restore it. However,
there were no troops to hold it, and as its abandonment would have
imperilled Amiens, Gen. Gough decided to muster an emergency detachment
of engineers, miners, electricians, mechanics, staff personnel,
pupils and instructors from the schools of the 3rd and 5th Armies,
and American sappers, in all about 2,200 men. This detachment, under
Maj.-Gen. Carey, was ordered to hold an eight-mile front and bar the
road to Amiens.</p>

<p>North of the Somme, the Germans attacked from Ervillers to the river;
the British left stood firm, whilst on the right, the hinge formed by
Byng's Army, likewise resisted. Further south, the Germans captured
Maricourt, and broke through the curtain of British troops, which
lost contact with one another. The Ancre was crossed, and Byng's
right, pivoting on Boyelles, fell back on the line Bucquoy, Albert,
Bray-sur-Somme.</p>

<p>General Pétain issued a stirring appeal to the men:</p>

<p><i>The enemy is attacking in a supreme effort to separate us from the
British, and open the road to Paris. At all cost, he must be held. Stick
to the ground, stand firm, reinforcements are at hand. United, you will
fling yourselves on the invader. Soldiers of the Marne, Yser and Verdun,
the fate of France is in your hands.</i></p>

<p>From all parts of the front, French divisions poured in. Long lines of
motor-lorries sped along all the roads converging towards Montdidier.
The high spirits and fine bearing of the men reassured the anxious
population, who, for several days past, had heard the guns drawing
nearer, and seen the endless stream of refugees fleeing before the
invader.</p>

<p>General Debeney arrived with his staff from Toul, to take command
of the 1st Army (in formation), divisions of which arrived each day.</p>

The operations of these two armies, whose task it was to bar the road
to Paris and cover Amiens, were co-ordinated by Gen. Fayolle.</p>

<h3>The Push towards Montdidier
and Fall of Roye.<br />
The Push towards Amiens
and Fall of Albert.</h3>

<p>On the <b>26th</b>, Gen. Pellé's group
occupied Mont Renaud&mdash;a natural
rampart protecting the valley
of the Oise.</p>

<p>Determined to force a passage
at all cost, the enemy attacked
with fresh troops.</p>

<p><i>The present positions must be held at all cost. The honour of each
commanding officer is at stake</i>, proclaimed Gen. Pellé. Trenches were
dug, and Mont Renaud organised. The road to Compiègne was barred and
the hills to the south and south-west of Noyon became the pivot of the
defences. Repeatedly attacked, Mont Renaud changed hands several times,
finally resting with the French. The exhausted 10th Div. fell back on
the <i>massif</i> of Le Plémont, where the 77th Div. had just taken up its
positions.</p>

<p>However, although Gen. Humbert's right checked all enemy advance, Gen.
Robillot's group and the first units of Gen. Debeney's Army, on the
left, were unable to hold their ground in the Picardy Plain. Forming
but a thin line, the enemy's powerful thrust opened gaps in places.</p>

<p>Units of the 56th and 133rd Inf. Divns. and of the 4th and 5th Cav.
Divns. under Gen. de Mitry, were pushed forward, with orders to
establish the liaison, on their right, with the 22nd Div., and on their
left, with the British who were falling back on the Santerre Plateau.
This liaison was necessarily weak, as the troops had to be deployed.
Fighting day and night for every inch of ground given up, these
splendid troops succeeded in retarding the enemy's advance until the
arrival of reinforcements on the line of the Avre.</p>

<p>The exhausted 22nd Div. fell back, carrying with it the 62nd on its
right. Roye, outflanked from the south and attacked on the north, was
lost. A breach, opened between the 22nd and 62nd Div. was filled by
an emergency detachment hastily got together on the spot by General
Robillot.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 26th, the front was established on the line
Echelle-St.-Aurin, Dancourt, Plessis-Cacheleux.</p>

<h3>Allied Unity of Command.</h3>

<p>Events had forcibly demonstrated the urgent necessity for Allied
unity of command. On March 26, a War Council, composed of
M.M. Poincaré, Clemenceau, Lord Milner, Haig, Pétain and Foch,
empowered the latter to <i>coordinate the action of the Allied Armies on
the Western Front</i>.</p>

<p>"At the moment when Foch was to take precedence of Pétain and
Haig, what was the position of the armies, as regards the directives of
the High Command? In other words, how was the Anglo-French battle
being directed? The position is defined in the General Orders of Pétain
and Haig, the former of whom prescribed:</p>

<p>"To keep the French forces grouped, to protect the Capital; <i>essential
mission</i>;</p>

<p>"To ensure the liaison with the British; <i>secondary mission</i>;</p>

<p>"The latter prescribed that everything possible should be done
to avoid severance from the French;</p>

<p>"Should this be unavoidable, <i>to fall back slowly, covering the Channel
Ports</i>.</p>

<p>"If we place these two orders side by side, <i>their divergence
strikes us painfully</i>. It is patent that the instructions of the two
great chiefs had not the same object in view, and did not tend
towards the same end. One was thinking of Paris, the other of the
Channel Ports. Each would evidently consecrate the bulk of his
forces and resources to what he considered the essential task. To
sum up: on the German side, there was only one battle; <i>on the
Allies' side, there were two: the battle for Paris, and the battle
for the ports</i>. Had this situation continued, our defeat was certain.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">British and French reinforcements in a village.</span>
(<cite>Photo imperial War Museum</cite>)</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Foch's first thought, from the moment he took over the
direction, was to cause this disastrous divergence to cease. To the
two commanders-in-chief he prescribed the maintenance, at all cost,
of the liaison between their armies. The accessory thus became
the essential. The vital point was to ensure the junction between
the Allied Armies, and to that end, to cover neither Paris, nor
Calais, but Amiens. The battle which, till then, had been double,
became single, i. e. <i>the Battle for Amiens</i>.</p>

<p>"Such was the strategical idea which, during the following days,
Foch strove to materialise. Motoring from G.H.Q. to G.H.Q., he
impressed the same thing upon all; on Haig, Pétain, Gough, the
latter's successor, Rawlinson, Fayolle, Debeney and Humbert. By
dint of repetition, this idea was to be deeply impressed into the
minds of the executants.</p>

<p>"To ensure liaison, to keep the troops where they were, to prevent
voluntary retreat, above all, to avoid effecting relief during
the battle, to throw the divisions into the line of fire, as they
arrived&mdash;such were the orders which were constantly on his lips during
the days which followed". (<cite>La bataille de Foch</cite>, by Raymond Recouly).</p>

<p>On March 28, General Pershing offered Foch the direct and immediate
help of the American Forces: <i>I come to tell you that the American
people would consider it a great honour for our troops to take part in
the present battle. I ask this of you in my name and theirs. At this
time, the only question is to fight. Infantry, artillery, aviation, all
we have is yours.</i></p>

<p>Henceforth, the battle was directed from Foch's headquarters,
temporarily installed at Beauvais. Twice a day, couriers maintained
communications between Foch and the British and French G.H.Q's.</p>

<h3>The Fall of Montdidier.<br />
The Growing Resistance on the Wings.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_024-1.jpg" alt="Map." />
</div>

<p>By the <b>27th</b>, the German attacks had lost much of their
earlier sting. The French, whose resistance was stiffening steadily,
harassed the enemy unceasingly.</p>

<p>Their infantry, now thirty-six miles from their base, could only
be revictualled with great difficulty. The Allied airmen bombed their
convoys and the railway stations incessantly.</p>

<p>Their artillery had difficulty in keeping up with the infantry, and
the latter were not always efficiently supported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Allies steadily organized their defences. Gen.
Pellé's group, with strong positions on the bastions of the Île de
France, repulsed the enemy's repeated assaults.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_024-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><i>Montdidier fell, but in face of the Allies' increasing<br />
resistance, the enemy could advance no further.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Five attacks on Mont Renaud were broken.</p>

<p>From Canny to the Oise, the Allies stood firm.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_photo_024-3.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">General Debeney.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Held on this front, the enemy deviated towards Montdidier,
overwhelming Gen. Robillot's forces, which fell back on Rollot. The
Germans reached Montdidier, Piennes, Rubescourt and Rollot.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>

A wide breach was thus made between Gen. Humbert's left and the right
of Gen. Debeney's Army, then taking up its positions on the tablelands
before the valley of the Avre.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_photo_029-1.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">General Rawlinson.</span><br />
<cite>Photo Russell, London.</cite></div>
</div>

<p>It was a tragic moment. Gen. Debeney
telegraphed to Gen. Fayolle: <i>There
is a gap of nine miles between the two
armies, with nobody to fill it. I ask
General Fayolle to have troops brought
up in motor-lorries and despatched north
of Ployron, to resist at least the passing
of the Cavalry.</i></p>

<div class="caption"><i>March 26-27.</i><br />
<i>British reinforcements arrived north of the<br />

</div>

<p>A few hours later, two divisions
of Humbert's Army filled the breach.</p>

<p>Exhausted by their terrible losses,
the enemy were brought to a stand.</p>

<p>East of Rollot, the essential portions
of the massif of Boulogne-la-Grasse
were strongly held.</p>

<p>Behind the Avre, trains and lorries
were bringing up the divisions of
Debeney's Army.</p>

<p>The British received reinforcements,
and stayed their retreat in
the outskirts of Albert.</p>

<p>The thrust against their line was
now less violent, the enemy forces
converging towards Montdidier.</p>

<p>Gen. Rawlinson replaced Gen.
Gough.</p>

<h3>The Battle for Amiens.<br />
The Allies consolidate their
front and counter-attack.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_030-1.jpg" alt="Map." />
</div>

<p>After the fall of Montdidier,
the fourteen divisions of von Hutier's
army converged towards
the pocket to the south-west.</p>

<p>Seven other divisions, marching
against the British front between
the Somme and Arras, suddenly
turned south. On the 28th,
80,000 Germans made for the
gap, through which 160,000 men
of von Hutier's army were already
pressing. In all, 240,000 men
were about to attack on a seventeen-mile
front.</p>

<p>General Humbert's left maintained
an aggressive defensive.</p>

<p>On <b>March 28</b>, they counter-attacked. The 4th Zouaves captured
Orvillers and Boulogne-la-Grasse, threatening the enemy on the flank at
Montdidier. Seeing the danger, the Germans retook part of the conquered
positions. The moral effect was, however, considerable, indicative as
it was of the Allies' determination to re-act.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 29th, these counter-attacks were continued, thus mobilising many
enemy units on this front, which were preparing to attack on the Avre.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">French artillery in Moreuil.</span></div>
</div>

<p>During these two days, General Debeney, further north, was concentrating
his forces along the front of Le Quesnel, Hangest, Pierrepont,
Mesnil-Saint-Georges, Rubescourt. <i>There can be no question,</i> he
declared, <i>of crossing to the left bank of the Avre</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_031-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><i>On March 29, the Germans were firmly held<br />

</div>

<p>The Germans attacked at dawn on the 28th. To the west of Montdidier,
Mesnil-St.-Georges was captured. The 166th Division, which had just
detrained, stayed the thrust at Grivesnes and Plessier. A battalion
of the 5th Cav. Div. fighting on foot, recaptured Mesnil and
Fontaine-sous-Montdidier.</p>

<p>At the junction with the British, the attack was more violent.
Capturing Hangest, the Germans slipped along the valley of the Luce,
driving back the British. The resistance of the latter stiffened,
however, and they maintained their positions on the right bank of the
Avre.</p>

<p>On the 29th, the enemy renewed the attack with fresh divisions,
especially at Demuin and Mézières, where the defenders were driven back
along the Avre. However, Gen. Debeney's Army was now completed by the
arrival of the 127th, 29th and 163rd Divisions. Its junction with the
British, was strongly reinforced.</p>

<p>Before Arras, astride the Scarpe, the British fell back into line with
Byng's Army, repulsing several violent attacks. (<i>Sketch, p. 26</i>).</p>

<p>On the evening of March 29, the enemy were firmly held at the
bottom of the pocket, the sides of which stood firm.</p>

<h3>The General Attack at the bottom of the Pocket and the holding
of the German Advance.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_032.jpg" alt="Map." />
</div>

<p>On <b>March 30</b>, the Germans
launched a general attack along a
thirty-mile front, from Moreuil to
Noyon, against the armies of Humbert
and Debeney. This was their
last effort in the southward push.</p>

<p>In many places, the French
heavy artillery had not yet taken
up its new positions. The battle
was therefore mainly one of infantry.
To the Air Service fell the
task of making good the deficiency,
and throughout the
battle, bombs were rained
upon the railway-stations, columns
of German infantry, and
enemy supply convoys, whilst
the fighting section, skimming
over the enemy masses, riddled
them with machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>In front of Humbert's Army,
the French lines were practically intact. Homeric combats were
delivered at Le Plémont, Plessis-de-Roye and before Orvillers.</p>

<p>In the region of Orvillers-Sorel, the 38th Div. repulsed four assaults
delivered by the 4th Div. of the Prussian Guards.</p>

<p>The attack against the front of Debeney's Army was delivered with
equal fury.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The enemy's final effort southwards.</span><br />
<i>March 30-April 5.</i></div>
</div>

<p>On its right, not an inch of ground was lost. All assaults
on Mesnil-Saint-Georges were repulsed. The 6th Corps maintained
practically all its positions intact, except before Hill 104, where a
slight withdrawal was necessary.</p>

<p>On the left wing, the 36th Corps (Nollet) was forced to give way,
and fell back on the Avre. Moreuil was lost in the evening of the
30th.</p>

<p><b>March 31</b> was marked by extremely violent local actions,
especially at Mesnil-St-Georges and Grivesnes, without appreciable
result for either side.</p>

</div>

<p>On the evening of the 31st, the French front, practically intact,
passed west of Moreuil, skirted the high ground on the left bank of
the Avre, running thence west of Cantigny, round Montdidier, along
the suburbs of Orvillers, through Roye-sur-Matz, Le Plémont and
the hills to the south of Noyon, where the Germans had been
unable to gain a footing.</p>

<p><b>April 1st.</b> The enemy sounded the French lines at Rollot,
south-east of Montdidier, but were smartly checked by a vigorous
counter-attack. Three attacks in front of Grivesnes were likewise
repulsed.</p>

<p>April 2 and 3 were fairly quiet, being the prelude to the final effort
against Debeney's Army.</p>

<p><b>April 4th.</b> At daybreak, an intense artillery preparation began,
extending from the north of Hangard to the south of Grivesnes.
At 7.30 a.m., the attack was launched with unheard-of violence.</p>

<p>Against this front, only nine miles wide, fifteen divisions&mdash;seven
of which were composed of fresh troops&mdash;attacked ten times in
the course of the day.</p>

<p>Before Grivesnes, four attacks were repulsed, whilst all the enemy's
efforts against Cantigny and Hill 104 broke down. Further north
the Germans captured Mailly-Raineval, Morisel and Castel.</p>

<p>The next day (<b>April 5th</b>), counter-attacks checked the Germans,
prevented them exploiting their success north of Montdidier, and
drove them back into Mailly-Raineval and Cantigny.</p>

<p>On the following days, fighting took place at different points, which
changed hands several times, but these actions were of a local nature
only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Results of the German Offensive of March 21.</h3>

<p>The great German attack was over. The roads to the south-west
were barred, as those to the south, at Noyon, had been, and Gen.
Debeney was able to address the following order to his troops:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Soldiers of the 1st Army</i>,<br />
<i>You have carried out your arduous task well.</i></p>

<p><i>Your tenacious resistance and vigorous counter-attacks have broken
the onrush of the invader, and ensured the liaison with our brave Allies,
the British. The great battle has begun. At this solemn hour, the whole
country is with us. The soul of the Mother-land uplifts our hearts.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>On April 4, the great battle&mdash;of which the battles for Amiens, Montdidier
and Compiègne were only episodes&mdash;came virtually to an end.</p>

<p>For ten days, after breaking the Allies' front, the Germans were
able to change the war of positions into one of movement, but by a
tremendous effort the French Army threw itself across their path and,
as at Verdun in 1916, checkmated them.</p>

<p>This warfare in the open did not give the results expected by the
enemy, who failed either to separate the Allies, or to rout them. On
the contrary, by bringing about Allied unity of command, they
strengthened the hands of their adversaries, to their own undoing.</p>

<p>Although the Germans captured Montdidier, they failed to reach
either Amiens or Compiègne, and whereas the British, at first severely
shaken, fully recovered, whilst only a portion of the French reserves
were engaged, the enemy used up a considerable part of their finest
troops and shock divisions, mown down in tens of thousands along the
road to Paris, by the Allies' machine-guns and field artillery.</p>

<p>By March 31, ninety enemy divisions had been engaged, twenty-five
of which had to be withdrawn on account of excessive casualties,
some of them (e. g. the 45th Reserve, certain units of the 2nd Guards
and 5th Infantry) having lost 50% of their effective strength. The
casualties of the 6th, 195th, 4th, and 119th divisions attained 75%.
At the very lowest estimation, the Germans lost at least 250,000 men.</p>

<p>The Kronprinz had promised his men that the Easter bells would
ring in the long-expected peace, but Easter Sunday found the Allies
more closely united than ever, awaiting with confidence the end of
the battle, and determined to win through to victory.</p>

<p>The check of April 4 saw the end of von Hutier's reserves. All
the divisions of the XVIIIth Army had been engaged, most of them
with heavy casualties. Unwilling to take any of the divisions from
the army group under the Bavarian Crown Prince&mdash;reserved for the
proposed offensive in Flanders&mdash;or the inferior and less trained
troops on the Champagne and Lorraine fronts, the German High
Command, realising that the struggle must develop into one of
attrition, like the first battle of the Somme, gave up for the time
being all idea of an offensive on the Somme-Oise front.</p>

<p>A document of the German XVIIIth Army refers to the operations
prior to April 6 under the name of "The Battle of Disruption" and
to those which followed, under the name of "The Fighting on the
Avre and in the region of Montdidier-Noyon."</p>

<p>The divisions forming von Hutier's shock troops were withdrawn
fairly quickly. By the end of May, only two out of the twenty-three
divisions which, on March 21, had formed the XVIIIth Army, were
still in line on the Moreuil-Oise front.</p>

<h3>The Trench Warfare Period.</h3>

<p>From April onwards, trench warfare began again. The Allied front was
reformed, consisting of a continuous line of hastily dug trenches and
rapidly constructed works, held by resolute troops, whose <em>morale</em> was
intact and whose fighting spirit had never been better.</p>

<p>Once more the heavy artillery came into requisition, for the preparatory
pounding of the adversaries' positions.</p>

<p>In April-May, sharp engagements frequently took place at certain
points. On the Luce, in the region of Hangard, on the Avre, from
Thennes to Mailly-Raineval, at
Grivesnes, on the west bank of the
Matz, and around Orvillers-Sorel. Of
these, the attack of April 24, by
its violence and scope, constituted a
veritable offensive against Amiens.</p>

<p>The enemy's main effort was made at this point, as being the weakest.</p>

<p>The French line started at Anchin Farm, west of Moreuil, followed
the western and northern outskirts of Castel, joined up with Hill 63
on the right bank of the Avre, took in Hangard, and linked up with
the British near Hill 99, to the south of Hangard Wood. From
this point the British line crossed the plateau between the Avre and
the Somme, between Marcelcave and Villers-Bretonneux, and passed
the eastern outskirts of Hamel.</p>

<p>At 5 a.m., after an artillery preparation lasting an hour, the German
infantry attacked.</p>

<p>After a desperate struggle, the enemy captured Villers-Bretonneux.
Hangard fell during the night and Cachy was threatened.</p>

<p>The next day, a Franco-British counter-attack won back the most
important part of the lost ground. Villers-Bretonneux, Hangard and
Hangard Wood were recaptured and held, in spite of all the subsequent
efforts of the enemy, who finally abandoned this sector in favour
of Flanders.</p>

<h3>Ludendorff's Opinion.</h3>

<p>In his "Memoirs", Ludendorff wrote: <i>The battle ended on April 4.
It was a brilliant feat of arms and will always be so considered
in history. What the British and French had been unable to do, we
accomplished in the fourth year of the war.</i></p>

<p><i>Strategically, we did not attain what the events of March 23, 24 and
25 justified our hoping for.</i></p>

<p><i>That we failed to take Amiens, which would have rendered the
communications of the enemy forces astride the Somme extremely
difficult, was especially disappointing.</i></p>

<p><i>Long distance bombardment of the railways could not be considered an
equivalent.</i></p>

<h2>THE ALLIES' OFFENSIVES IN PICARDY.<br />
<span class="small">August-September 1918.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>After the German Offensive of March.</b></p>

<p>After the check of their offensive in Picardy, the Germans attempted,
by means of secondary offensives, to attain those results which
they had failed to obtain in the first instance.</p>

<p>On April 9, they attacked in Flanders, from Béthune to the north
of Ypres, in the direction of the Channel Ports, but failed to take
Ypres, or to reach Hazebrouck. (<cite>See the Guide</cite>: <b>Ypres</b>.)</p>

<p>On May 27, the front of the Chemin des Dames was attacked by
surprise, the enemy reaching the banks of the Marne.
(<cite>See the Guide</cite>:
<b>The Second Battle of the Marne</b>).</p>

<p>From June 9 to 18, their efforts were turned against the salients of
the Aisne and Rheims. On June 11, they captured the <i>massif</i> of
Thiescourt, but were held before Compiègne. In front of Rheims the
road was barred by the French Colonial troops.
(<i>See the Guide</i>: <b>Rheims</b>.)</p>

<p>Lastly, seeking a prompt decision at all cost, and hypnotised by
Paris, the Germans planned a still more formidable offensive: the
"Friedensturm" or Peace Battle. However, the French High Command
were not taken unawares. The scope and time of the offensive
were known, and the Germans failed.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3>The Strategy and Tactics of the Allies.</h3>

<p>The hour of the counter-offensive was about to strike. The Allies had
overcome the crisis due to the shortage of men. The British Army
had been reorganized. The American forces had greatly increased in
numbers. The fighting spirit of the French was higher than ever.
The material strength of the Allies was satisfactory, and included
large numbers of the new offensive arm: the tank, destined to relieve
and support the infantry, and combat the German shock troops.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Allies were now grouped under a single chief: Foch,
who knew where and when to strike.</p>

<p><i>The Allied Armies</i>, he declared, <i>have arrived at the turning of the
ways; in the thick of battle they have regained the initiative, and
their strength enables them to retain it; the principles of war command
them to do so. The time has come to abandon the defensive attitude
necessitated till now by numerical inferiority, and to take the
offensive.</i></p>

<p><i>The action of the Commander-in-chief of the Allied Armies will, in
future, aim at maintaining his hold on the German Commandment, giving
him no respite which would allow him to recover and reconstitute
his forces. To that end, separate surprise attacks will be made
successively, as rapidly as possible, so as to augment progressively
the disorganization of the enemy's armies and the confusion of the
German Commandment, until the day of the general offensive, and of the
final attack which will crumble up the whole of the adversary's front.</i></p>

<p>A comparison of this conception of Foch's with that of Ludendorff
brings out all its suppleness and power.</p>

<p>The counter-offensive by the armies of Mangin and Degoutte in
the Château-Thierry pocket, begun on July 18, was scarcely over,
when the Second Battle of the Somme broke out.</p>

<p>In this new battle of the Somme, the retreat of the German armies
on the Hindenburg Line, in August-September 1918, was effected
under the pressure of four successive thrusts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I.&mdash;The operations carried out simultaneously by the British 4th
Army and the French 1st and 3rd Armies against the Albert, Montdidier,
Lassigny salient, to clear the Paris-Amiens railway. (<i>Pages 38-45.</i>)</p>

<p>II.&mdash;The British offensive north of the Somme, coinciding with the
French offensive between the Oise and the Aisne. (<i>Pages 46-49.</i>)</p>

<p>III.&mdash;The British offensive on the Scarpe and the French offensive
on the Ailette. (<i>Page 50.</i>)</p>

<h2>I.&mdash;THE ATTACK ON THE SALIENT OF
ALBERT-MONTDIDIER-LASSIGNY.<br />
<span class="smaller">August 8-13, 1918.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><b>Preliminary Operations of July.</b></p>

<p>Throughout July, the Allies carried out different local operations,
in order to improve their positions and prepare for the coming
offensive.</p>

<p>As early as July 4, Australians supported by Americans, had begun
to advance between Villers-Bretonneux and the Somme, by capturing
the village and wood of Hamel.</p>

<p>On July 9, after a brilliant attack between Castel and the north
of Mailly-Raineval, the French captured Castel, and on the 23rd,
Mailly-Raineval, which brought them nearer the Avre.</p>

<p>These different actions, and the flattening of the Cantigny salient
by the American 1st Div. on May 28, had warned the enemy.</p>

<p>On August 2, the Germans fell back on the Ancre, and on the 3rd
to the Avre. The bulk of their forces were withdrawn east of these
rivers, leaving only light forces on the west bank.</p>

<p>On the Marne, Ludendorff had just suffered a severe defeat. From
July 18 to August 4, his armies had been driven back from the Marne
to the Vesle, where they organized new positions. (<i>See the Guide</i>:
<b>The Second Battle of the Marne</b>.) In the belief that this effort had
temporarily exhausted the Allies, Ludendorff was planning new operations
in Flanders, when he was surprised by a new and powerful
Allied Offensive. From that point, the initiative remained with Foch.</p>

</div>

<p>On August 8, the front line passed west of Albert, east of
Villers-Bretonneux, then followed the left bank of the Avre, and the
Doms stream, west of Montdidier, running thence towards the Matz and
the Oise, via Assainvillers, west of Cuvilly and Chevincourt.</p>

<p>From north to south, the enemy front was held by the IInd Army (von
Marwitz) (10 Divns. in line from Albert to Moreuil), and by the XVIIIth
Army (von Hutier) (11 Divns. from Moreuil to the Oise).</p>

<p>These two armies, with 21 divisions in line, engaged 17 other
divisions during the course of the battle, i. e. 38 divisions in
all.</p>

<h3>The Franco-British Attack of August 8, 1918.</h3>

<p>These armies attacked on August 8, along a 15-mile front, from
the Ancre to the Avre.</p>

<p>"<i>At 4.20 a.m., after three formidable cannon-shots,&mdash;the signal for
the opening of the attack,&mdash;the rolling barrage broke out before the
Australian and Canadian troops, who immediately dashed forward. At the
same time, the heavy and light tanks, armoured cars and motor-lorries,
loaded with supplies and ammunition, set out. At certain points, the
cavalry, followed by the artillery and the aeroplanes, guarded or
speeded up the advance. The enemy were taken completely by surprise.
The troops and staffs were taken prisoners before they realized what
had happened. One after another, the villages were surrounded and
captured. Forging ahead of the infantry, the cavalry and tanks spread
panic everywhere.</i>"</p>

<p>The British advanced rapidly in the direction of Rosières, along
both sides of the Amiens-Chaulnes railway.</p>

<p>Towards evening, the advanced line passed through Mézières, Caix
and Cerisy. Everywhere, except at Morlancourt, north of the Somme,
where the enemy resisted desperately, the Germans were routed.</p>

<p>More than 13,000 prisoners, a general and the staff of an army
corps, and 300 guns had fallen
into the hands of the British
by 9 a.m.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_044.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><i>August 8.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Along the front of Debeney's
Army, the artillery preparation
was short but violent,
(45 minutes). The infantry
attacked about five o'clock
i.e. after the British. The
ground, divided for the greater
part by the valley of the Avre,
was more difficult, and
General Debeney counted
rather on man&#339;uvering, than
on surprise.</p>

<p>The attack began on a
front of 2½ miles, south
of the Amiens-Roye road,
debouching from the valley
of the Luce towards ground
suitable for the tanks, the
troops being gradually engaged
on their right, along the
Avre.</p>

<p>At 8 a.m., two divisions
turned Moreuil Wood, from
the north-east and south-west. On the Avre, another division
captured Morisel, whilst to the south of Moreuil a battalion crossed
the river. Moreuil, turned from the north and south, fell. South of
Moreuil, two fresh divisions crossed the Avre, opposite Braches, opening
up a way for the troops who had to fight on the plateaux.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, after an advance of about five miles, the
French reached the line Braches, La Neuville-Sire-Bernard, and
joined hands with the British near Mézières. 3,300 prisoners, including
three regimental commandants, were taken.</p>

<p>On <b>August 9-10</b>, the British thrust and the French man&#339;uvre
developed.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p class="center"><span class="large"><span class="smcap">The British Advance.</span></span></p>

<p>Between Albert and the Amiens-Roye road, the Canadians and
Australians harassed the enemy without respite, and advanced several
kilometres, capturing Bouchoir, Méharicourt, Rosières, Lihons and
Proyart.</p>

<p>North of the Somme, in co-operation with American troops, they
captured Morlancourt village
and plateau to the south-east,
where the enemy resisted
desperately.</p>

<p>On the <b>11th</b>, in spite of
stubborn resistance, the
British reached the Dernancourt
crossroads, about a
mile west of Bray, Chilly,
Fouquescourt and the western
suburbs of Villers-les-Roye.</p>

<p>On the <b>12th</b>, they drove
the enemy for good out of
Proyart. On the <b>13th</b>, they
reached the suburbs of Bray-sur-Somme
and the crossroads
of Chuignolles. The
front now ran along the old
German lines of the Somme
Battlefield of 1916, where
the enemy, thanks to a
number of strong points of
support, succeeded in staying
the advance. In five
days, the British had scored
a fine victory, their forces
(13 infantry divisions, one
regiment of the American
33rd Division, 3 divisions
of cavalry, and 400 tanks)
defeating 20 German divisions,
advancing 12 miles,
and capturing 22,000 prisoners
and 400 guns.</p>

<h3>The French Man&#339;uvre. Liberating Montdidier.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, General Debeney, by a series of turning movements,
brought about the fall of important sections of the German front, without
frontal attacks.</p>

<p>Constantly extending his attacks along the Avre, the approaches
to the river on the north and north-east, as far as the confluence with
the Doms stream, were cleared, whilst his hold on Montdidier, from
the north-east, gradually tightened.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">British Cavalry near Albert.</span>

</div>

<p>On <b>August 9</b>, the French line was advanced as far as the station
of Hangest-en-Santerre, on the Albert-Rosières-Montdidier railway.</p>

<p>In order to force the enemy to abandon Montdidier, without a frontal
attack, General Debeney began a turning movement at about 4 p.m.
A secondary attack was launched in the direction of Roye, between
Domelieu and Le Ployron. The station of Montdidier and Faverolles
Village on the Montdidier-Roye line, were reached that evening.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, the French airmen bombed Roye undisturbed
by the enemy's planes or air-defence guns.</p>

<p>By <b>evening</b>, the 1st Army had taken 5,000 prisoners. From Faverolles,
they threatened to join up with the men who had advanced
north, via Davenescourt, and to cut off the Germans in Montdidier.</p>

<p>The latter was evacuated in great disorder the same night and on
the following morning, only a few machine-gunners being left behind
to retard the French advance as long as possible.</p>

<p>On <b>August 10</b>, at noon, the French entered the ruined town, and
advanced rapidly eastward, beyond Fescamps, on both sides of the
road to Roye. In the evening, they reached the line Villers-les-Roye
(where they joined hands with the British) and Grivillers.</p>

<p>On the <b>11th</b>, they captured the park and village of Tilloloy. By
the evening of the <b>12th</b>, the 1st Army had taken 8,500 prisoners
(including 181 officers), 250 guns, numerous minenwerfer, 1,600
machines-guns, and huge quantities of stores.</p>

<h2>II.&mdash;THE BRITISH OFFENSIVE NORTH OF THE SOMME AND<br />
THE FRENCH OFFENSIVE BETWEEN THE OISE AND AISNE.<br />
<span class="smaller">August 18-29.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>The first phase of the Battle of Picardy was ended, but a great
new effort, between the Somme and the Scarpe, was being prepared.</p>

<p>Between the Aisne and the Oise, Mangin's Army attacked the plateaux
on August 18th, advancing to the
Ailette on the 23rd. (<i>Sketch above</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><i>The Attack between the Oise and Aisne<br />

and Humbert, August 18-23.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Following up this advance, Humbert's
Army continued its offensive
vigorously on the 21st, conquered
the northern slopes of Le Plémont,
crossed the Divette, and occupied
Lassigny. (<i>Sketch above</i>).</p>

<p>By their advance, these two armies
threatened the right of the German
XVIIIth Army, established on the
Chaulnes-Roye line.</p>

<p>At the same time, Byng's Army
attacked between the Ancre and Croisilles,
whilst Rawlinson's left attacked
north of the Somme. (<i>Sketch above</i>).</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><i>The Attack between the Somme and Scarpe<br />
by Byng and Rawlinson, August 21-29.</i></div>
</div>

<p>At dawn, on <b>August 21</b>, the 4th and
6th Corps of Byng's Army attacked
between Miraumont and Moyenneville.</p>

<p>Supported by tanks, they captured
the advance defences in brilliant style.</p>

<p>The fighting was particularly severe
around Achiet-le-Grand and Logeast
Wood, where, however, the advance
continued steadily. The Arras-Albert
railway which was the enemy's principal
line of defence, was reached,
2,000 prisoners being taken.</p>

<p>After this preparatory attack, the
offensive was launched on <b>August
22</b>, along a thirty-two mile front, between
Lihons and Mercatel.</p>

<p>South of the Somme, the Australians
captured Herleville and Chuignes,
with 2,000 prisoners. Rawlinson's left
crossed the Ancre, took Albert, and
advanced its front to the hills east
of the Albert-Braye road, capturing
2,400 prisoners.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_046-3.jpg" alt="Map." />
</div>

<p>But the hardest blow was struck
further north by Byng's Army.

of defence (the Arras-Albert railway),

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>

the 4th and 6th Corps took Gomiécourt, Ervillers, Boyelles, many
guns, and more than 5,000 prisoners, then pushed on towards
Bapaume and Croisilles. The 6th
Corps, astride the Arras-Bapaume
road, marched on Bapaume, threatening
to cut off the Germans who
were hanging on to the Heights of
Thiepval. The latter, attacked at
the same time further south, fell.
Bray-sur-Somme was also captured.</p>

<p>The battle continued from the 25th
to the 29th, the enemy's resistance
stiffening steadily.</p>

<p>Counter-attacking, the Germans
defended this old battlefield of 1916,
strewn with obstacles, with great desperation.</p>

<p>On the <b>29th</b>, Bapaume fell, and the
Germans retreated from the north of
that town to the Somme, on the line
Cléry, Combles, Frémicourt, Bullecourt,
and Heudecourt.</p>

<p>Threatened by the British to the

French on the banks of the Oise,
the Germans began their retreat
in the bend of the Somme. Closely

<span class="smaller">August 25-September 8, 1918.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Pursuing his plan of offensive, Foch extended the field of operations.
Writing to Field-Marshal Haig, he said: <i>Continue your operations,
leaving the enemy no respite, and developing the scope of your
actions. It is this increasing breadth of the offensive, fed from the rear
and strongly pressed in front, without limitation of objective, without
consideration for the alignment and too close liaison, which will give
us the greatest results with the least losses.... The armies of General
Pétain are going forward again in the same manner.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>At the time Mangin's Army was preparing to crush the enemy's
front between the Aisne and
St. Gobain, Horne's Army,
on the Scarpe, attacked the
salient east of Arras.</p>

<p>On <b>August 25</b>, the Canadians,
astride the Scarpe,
and the left of Byng's Army
captured the difficult positions
of Monchy-le-Preux, Guémappe
and R&#339;ux, bringing
their line into contact with
the redoubtable position of
Quéant-Drocourt, a ramification
of the Hindenburg Line.</p>

<p>On <b>September 2</b>, the Canadians
attacked, progressing
rapidly along the Arras-Cambrai
road. Penetrating
the German lines to a depth of
6 miles, they reached Buissy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>On the night of August 30,
the Australians, in the centre,
furiously attacked and captured the formidable
bastion of Mont-St-Quentin.
On <b>September 1</b>, they entered Péronne,
after desperate fighting. To flank this
attack on the north, Bouchavesnes and
Frégicourt were captured.</p>

<p>Further south, on the Oise, Humbert's
Army, in spite of the enemy's
resistance, took Noyon and the high
ground dominating the town. Advancing
from the Ailette, towards Chauny,
Mangin's left reached the outskirts of
St. Gobain Forest, in the old lines of
March 1918.</p>

Cambrai, and on the south along

the Oise, in the direction of La Fère, and violently attacked at the
same time in the centre at Péronne, the Germans retreated towards
the Hindenburg positions. The British and French forces drove
back the enemy rear-guards, which were unable to hold the line of
the Tortille and the Canal du Nord.</p>

<p>On <b>Sept. 8</b>, the Allied front ran west of Arleux and Marquion,
through Havrincourt, Épéhy and Vermand, then followed the Crozat Canal.</p>

<h2>IV.&mdash;THE OFFENSIVES AGAINST THE OUTWORKS OF THE
HINDENBURG LINE.<br />
<span class="smaller">September 10-25.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Germans had reached the advanced defences of their famous
Hindenburg Line, consisting of the old British lines lost in March.
These formidable positions protected the ramparts of the Hindenburg
Line, said to be impregnable.</p>

<p>On <b>September 10</b>, the British 3rd and 4th Armies (Byng and
Rawlinson) attacked between Havrincourt and Holnon.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_051.jpg" alt="Map." />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>The 4th Army took Vermand, the western outskirts of Holnon
Woods, and gained a footing in Épéhy and Jeancourt. On the 13th,
after desperate fighting, it captured
the woods and village of Holnon.</p>

<p>The 3rd Army crossed the Canal
du Nord, south of the Bapaume-Cambrai
road, turned the positions
from Havrincourt to Gouzeaucourt,
and captured the greater part of
them, the enemy resisting desperately.</p>

<p>The same day (Sept. 12), the
American 1st Army captured the
whole of the St. Mihiel Salient, with
15,000 prisoners and 200 guns. (<i>See
the Guide</i>: <b>The Battle of St. Mihiel</b>.)</p>

<p>On the <b>18th</b>, a general attack
was launched by the British 3rd
and 4th Armies, in liaison with the
French 1st Army. All the enemy's
positions between Gouzeaucourt
and Holnon were captured, with
10,000 prisoners and 150 guns.</p>

<p>To the south, Debeney's Army
took over the front of Humbert's
Army&mdash;transferred to the sector
of the 10th Army&mdash;the latter,
due to the shortening of the front,
being sent to Lorraine, for a new
offensive.</p>

<p>Debeney's Army, extending south
of the Oise, attacked, and after
capturing Dallon Spur, Castres and
Essigny-le-Grand, reached the valley
of the Oise, from Vendeuil to La Fère.</p>

<i>Méharicourt, between Chaulnes and Caix, in 1919.</i></div>
</div>

<p>Disorganized and exhausted, their ranks depleted, the enemy were
now incapable of attempting a counter-offensive.</p>

<p>To avoid this continuous, exhaustive battle, the Germans sought
refuge in positions which they believed to be impregnable, and where
they hoped to rest, reorganize and reconstitute their reserves.</p>

<p>This was an imperious necessity, as from July 15 to September 25,
163 of their divisions had been engaged, 75 of them two or three times.</p>

<p>On September 26, despite a reduction of 120 miles in the length of
the front, they were forced to maintain practically the same number
of divisions in line as on July 15, owing to their decreased effective
strength and fighting value.</p>

<p>Moreover, to keep these forces effective, ten divisions had to be
dissolved, and the battalions of fifty others reduced from four to three
companies. Large numbers of men were called up from the works,
in order to husband their last resources&mdash;the 1920 recruits.</p>

<p>Everywhere, the Allied armies were in contact with the Hindenburg
Line, ready for the grand assault against the formidable positions
from which the enemy had set out on March 21 for Paris and victory.</p>

<p><i>The above photograph represents an assemblage of the

</blockquote>

<p>In six weeks, by repeated, inter-related attacks, vigorously executed
without respite, the Allies had flattened out the salient from St.
Quentin to beyond Montdidier and Albert, produced by the German push.</p>

<p>The end was near. To avoid a military disaster without precedent
in the world's history, the enemy soon afterwards sued for an armistice
and peace.</p>

<b>Longueau</b> <i>is soon reached.</i></p>

<p>The road from Amiens to the crossing over the river Avre, before
reaching Longueau, follows the left bank of the Somme. Market-gardens
famous for their fertility and known locally as "<i>hortillonnages</i>"
lie in the valley, especially around
Camon. Formerly, the river-side <em>seigneurs</em>
above Amiens, met once a year
for wild swan-shooting in the valley
of the Somme. The custom died out
in the 18th century, poaching having
by then exterminated the swans.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>It was at Longueau that the Roman
roads from Amiens to Rheims and to
St. Quentin crossed the river Avre.
Gallo-Roman tombstones were discovered
in 1848, while excavating near the
first bridge at Longueau. In 1590, the
Leaguers held the village to ransom, and the Spaniards burnt it in 1636.</p>

<p><i>Beyond Longueau, leave the Montdidier road on the right, and keep

<h3>The Battle of 1870.</h3>

<p>It was around Villers-Bretonneux that on November 27, 1870, part
of the battle known as the "Battle of Amiens", was fought between
the Prussians and the French Army of the North.</p>

<p>The French troops, about 10,000 in number, under the command
of General Farre, were deployed from the railway (between
Villers-Bretonneux and Marcelcave) to Cachy and Gentelles (on the Boves
road), and on the high ground dominating the valleys of the Somme,
Luce and Avre. The Prussians, under General Manteuffel, far more
numerous and better equipped with artillery than the French, debouched
from the valley of the Luce and the roads from Péronne
and Roye to Amiens, the battle opening on the two wings.</p>

<p>The enemy partly took Cachy and approached Gentelles, but were
driven back towards the river Luce, after the brilliant capture of Domart
Wood by the French. Cachy, partly abandoned by the French
after desperate resistance and heavy losses, was afterwards cleared
of the enemy with great dash.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the French line from Cachy to Villers-Bretonneux
was too weakly held to stay the Prussians, who got the upper hand
in the afternoon and forced the French back. To the enemy's
forty guns the French could only oppose sixteen (four batteries), and
they were, moreover, short of ammunition.</p>

<p>A Prussian battery, which had succeeded in taking up a position
near Cachy, enfiladed the French line. In Villers-Bretonneux, detachments
of French Marines fought a violent engagement in the streets,
giving ground only step-by-step. The enemy sustained heavy losses
and were unable seriously to hamper the French withdrawal towards
Corbie and Amiens.</p>

<p>A monument was erected at Villers-Bretonneux, south of the railway,
to the memory of the French soldiers who fell in this battle.</p>

<p>Fierce fighting took place in 1918 around the monument, which
was completely destroyed.</p>

<h3>The Battles of 1918.</h3>

<p>Prolonged and violent engagements were fought from March to August,
1918, in the vicinity of Villers-Bretonneux, for the possession of
Amiens. The battlefield consisted of a plateau occupied, from north-east
to south-west, by Villers-Bretonneux, Abbé Wood, Cachy and
Gentelles. This plateau was the last dominating position in front of
Amiens. From Villers-Bretonneux, situated on the main road from
St. Quentin to Amiens, and ten miles from the latter, the ground slopes
gradually down towards the great Picardian City and the confluence of
the rivers Avre and Somme.</p>

</div>

<p>From March 28 onwards, this plateau was held by Australian divisions,
the famous Anzacs, who covered themselves with glory there
by staying the Germans. At the beginning of April, the latter attempted
to outflank Villers from the north and south, with but little success.

On the 24th, after a bombardment with high explosive and gas
shells, lasting the whole of the previous night, they threw four divisions
(50,000 men), supported by five tanks each fitted with three
guns and a central turret, against the Fouilloy-Cachy front, barely
three miles wide. From 7 to 10 a.m., the attacking waves went
forward unceasingly in the morning mists. At about 11 a.m., the
British had to give way, under an intensely fierce onslaught, and the
Germans entered Villers from the north and south.</p>

<p>Clinging to the western approaches of the village, the British,
throughout the afternoon and night of the 24th, prevented the enemy
from debouching, while their artillery fire made the position
practically untenable. Two German battalions only were able to maintain
themselves in the cellars and ruins of the houses. In the evening
of the 25th, while troops of the Moroccan Division recaptured the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>

monument south of the Villers railway, British units debouched from
Abbé Wood, and advancing via the ravine north of Villers, Aquenne Wood
and the station to the south, surrounded and recaptured the village
after a hand-to-hand fight lasting all night. A 3-gun tank and over 700
prisoners were taken. To the south-west, in the vicinity of Cachy and
Gentelles, the enemy check was equally severe. On the 24th, a regular
battle of tanks took place near Cachy, in which the Germans were routed
and Cachy re-occupied. The four German divisions lost the battle, and
left the ground covered with their dead.</p>

<p>On May 2, there was again sharp fighting near the Monument, but
during the following weeks, the enemy ceased their attacks. The
Australians, by local operations, enlarged their positions north-east
of Villers-Bretonneux and between Villers and the Somme. On the night
of May 23, the enemy violently bombarded Villers, and on the 25th
made another powerful effort south of the village, but without success.</p>

<h3>Hill 104.</h3>

<p>Hill 104, at the crossing of the Demuin-Moreuil road with the
Roye-Amiens road, commands the valleys of the Luce and the Avre.</p>

<p>Hangard and Hangard Wood, seen to the north, were the scene of furious
fighting in 1918. This vital position enabled the Germans to hold the
river Luce, which they needed to consolidate the Montdidier-Moreuil
salient, and for their advance south-east of Amiens.</p>

<p>As early as March 27, units of Debeney's Army, under the command
of General Mesple, were pushed south of the Luce in support of the
British who were holding the line: Le Quesnel, Beaucourt, Cayeux,
Guillaucourt and Proyart. However, on the 28th, the Germans carried
Guillaucourt, north of Cayeux, descended to the woods in the Luce
Valley, and drove back the British in the neighbourhood of Cayeux.
Meanwhile, General Mesple's detachment, in accordance with instructions,
stubbornly held their positions on the Caix-Le Quesnel plateau,
although unprotected on their left. The first battalions of the French
22nd Division were despatched immediately on arrival to Hangard
and Domart, in support of the British. On the 29th, the Germans
attacked Demuin on the Luce and forced the Allies to abandon
Mézières and to fall back on Moreuil and the Avre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 31st, they gained a footing in Hangard after prolonged
efforts. In the evening and throughout the night they vainly attempted
to enlarge their gains to the west. The Franco-British troops
repulsed all assaults and prevented the enemy debouching from
the village, which the French soon afterwards recaptured in a dashing
counter-attack. On April 4, the Germans attempted to turn Hangard
from the south and attacked Hill 104. After getting to within
50 yards of it, they were checked at the foot of the hill, and fell back
in disorder. They then attempted to slip in along the ravines, but
the Allied artillery drove them back with very heavy losses.</p>

<p>On the 6th and 8th, fighting was resumed in the vicinity of Hangard,
where the French 29th Division held their ground. On the 9th,
Hangard was lost and retaken, together with the cemetery situated
about 200 yards east of the village. On the 11th, a fresh German
attack was made against the Hangard-Hourges front. The enemy,
held before Hourges, gained a footing in Hangard, where the fighting
was desperate. On the morning of the 12th, the Germans surrounded
the château and occupied the whole of the wood on Hill 104. A
single French battalion in the village held out against four German
battalions. In the direction of Hourges the enemy was held.</p>

<p>In Hangard Château, the French battalion, although surrounded
since 10 a.m., was still holding out at 6.30 p.m., in spite of repeated
attacks. At nightfall, a counter-attack by one French and one British
battalions recaptured the village and castle, and drove back the
enemy to the cemetery. 127 men, 3 officers and 15 machine-guns
were captured, and 35 Allied prisoners released. On April 15, before
it was relieved, the 29th Division, which had performed prodigies of
valour in its efforts to save Hangard, made it a point of honour to
clear the village entirely before leaving. One company carried the
cemetery in brilliant style. On the 19th, a German effort against the
village and wood failed. On the 24th, the fighting was again fiercest
around Hangard, which was defended by only one battalion. A whole
German division attacked and after carrying the wood boarded the
village from the north. At the same time they attacked Hill 104
from the south, at the foot of which they had been held on the 4th.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>

Enfiladed by machine-guns posted in front of Thennes, the Germans
failed to reach that village, but persisted in their efforts against
Hangard. After seven furious onslaughts, from 6.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.,
they occupied the cemetery, in which a single company, entirely cut
off from all support, held out all that day. Units of the battalion, hard
pressed from the north, east and south, shut themselves up with their
Commandant in the Château, and made a vigorous defence. Between 3 and
5 p.m., the following message was signalled three times: "<i>Surrounded
in Hangard but still holding out</i>". At 6 p.m. the Château was stormed,
and the commandant taken prisoner with the remaining survivors. Taking
advantage of the confusion caused by the French bombardment among his
captors, he escaped with his men and re-entered the castle, where he
continued to hold out until nightfall. He was finally captured in the
course of another attack.</p>

</div>

<p>In spite of their strenuous efforts, the Germans were unable to
debouch from Hangard during the night. On the 25th, the French
counter-attacked, and after crossing the Luce at various points,
re-occupied Verger hamlet, Hangard village, and part of Hangard Wood,
repulsing all German counter-attacks.</p>

<p>On the 26th, the 4th Regiment of the Moroccan Division completed
the clearing of the wood. Although the British attack on their
right was unsuccessful, a battalion of "Légionnaires" succeeded in
outflanking the north-eastern corner of the wood, in which they gained
a footing. They were followed soon afterwards by a second battalion
supported by British tanks which undertook the destruction of the
German machine-guns nests. Driven from the wood, the Germans
bombarded it heavily with 6in. and 8in. shells, but could not drive
out the French. Finally the Germans retreated 2 kms, two of their
divisions being thrown into disorder. One of them, which had just
relieved the other, suffered such heavy losses that it had to be sent to
the rear two days after coming into line. On the 28th, the Germans
launched unsuccessful counter-attacks against the wood, which was
finally cleared by French Infantry and British tanks. Thereafter,
the enemy were unable to make any advance in this region.</p>

is</i> a French cemetery. <em>Go through</em> <b>Beaucourt</b>, <em>and keep along
the road to</em> <b>Caix</b> (<i>See map, p. 66</i>). Saps, battery positions,
and a German cemetery are to be seen along the road. Caix is an
ancient market-town. Objects dating from the Bronze Age have been
discovered there. The 15th-16th century Sainte-Croix Church (<cite>Hist.
Mon.</cite>), standing halfway up the hill, is of archæological interest. The
famous square belfry on the left is flanked to the top by buttresses
surmounted by four low, massive corbel-turrets with bell-shaped
roofs. A door in the western front forms a low overhanging arch with
accolade-shaped archivolts, ornamented with inset pinnacles.</p>

<p>A large doorway in the façade, comprising two elliptical leaves, is
surmounted by high, pointed arcading forming a tympanum. On the
first story, a delicate, open-work balustrade recalls that of Tilloloy;
above is a fine rose window. The roof was rebuilt on modified lines
after the terrible fire of April 1768, which practically destroyed the
whole village. The south front doorway dates from 1530. Its arch is
ornamented with delicately carved vine-foliage.</p>

<p>The 16th century pillars, without capitals, in the nave, are decorated
with finely carved canopies, several of which are mutilated. The
present consoles and statues standing against the pillars are unfortunately
not the original ones. In the aisles, the brackets on which the
springing of the pointed arches rests, are ornamented with figures of
persons, lizards and dæmons... The pillars of the choir with their
foliate capitals, and the transept and chancel are 14th century. The
high altar comprises a reredos. The carved pulpit and confessional are
in the Renaissance style. The richly ornamented font has disappeared.
A large holy-water basin of unusual shape (truncated cone) is adorned
with several black circles.</p>

<p>All the zinc and lead-work
was stripped off and
taken away by the Germans
during the occupation
of 1918. The wooden
leaves of the entrance door
were removed. The building
suffered severely from
the bombardments. The
upper part of the belfry
fell down and the stained
glass was destroyed. Part
of the cornice and the
frame-work of the chevet
were ruined.</p>

<p>The fortified château of
Caix, vestiges of which
still remain, was destroyed
by fire in 1400.</p>

<p>The village did not suffer greatly from the bombardments.</p>

<p>Caix was captured by the Germans on March 28, 1918, and retaken
by the British at the same time as Beaucourt-en-Santerre, on the evening
of August 8, i. e. the first day of the British offensive in Picardy.</p>

<p>The village of Mézières was attacked by the Germans, on March 28,
1918, after the withdrawal of the British. On the 29th, units of the
French 133rd Division, which were defending Mézières, were unable
to hold the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, who captured the

village. On August 8, at the beginning of the offensive by Debeney's
Army, the village was recaptured by the 42nd Division, while
the 37th Division progressed east of Genonville Wood.</p>

</div>

<p>The Château, comprising the ruins
of four bastions with very thick
walls, was rebuilt in the 14th or
15th century on the site of a previous
castle which probably stood
near the church. In 1434, it was
besieged and captured by the Anglo-Burgundians.
In 1588, it was
occupied by the Leaguers. In
1636, during the disastrous "Corbie year", it was taken by the Spaniards,
from whom the French wrested it shortly afterwards. In 1791,
it was pillaged by the people, like the Château of Mailly-Raineval.
Ancient cannon from the Château are now in the Museum of Picardy
at Amiens. The modern portion, which served as a living apartment,
stood between the two western towers, and was built under

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>

Louis XVIII. It is now in ruins (<i>photo p. 28</i>). A large stone cross,
which formerly stood before the doorway of the parish church, was
removed and erected near the chapel of the Château. This 14th century
monument comprised a pedestal of three superimposed stories, and a
columnar shaft and cross, slightly more modern than the pedestal.
The cross has disappeared, and only part of the pedestal remains.</p>

(<cite>Hist. Mon.</cite>) bears a great likeness to that of St. Peter's Church

illustrious house of Mailly. The Château, in ruins since 1879, was
mostly built in the 16th century, on the site of the former castle,
destroyed at the time of the <i>Jacquerie</i>. The ruins of the Château
include a broken tower dating from the end of the 14th century, and
substructures still measuring 250 feet in length. The latter, which
were severely damaged by the bombardments, used to support the three
stories of the imposing Château (<i>photo above</i>). The village is now

<p>On March 26, 1918, the French 133rd Division, brought up in lorries,
and the 4th Cavalry Division, had orders to protect the approaches
to Moreuil and the Avre, and to join hands with the British, but
were forced to give way under the pressure of the enemy's overwhelming
numbers. On the 29th, the French 163rd Division had scarcely
detrained when it received orders to defend Moreuil, under the direction
of the General commanding the 36th Corps, forming the left
of Debeney's Army. The attack, led by two German divisions,
began on the night of the 29th. Moreuil, as the nearest point to
Amiens, was particularly aimed at by the enemy, but the Canadians
and French repulsed all assaults. Finally, after changing hands
several times, the village was occupied by the Germans who were,
however, unable to debouch, although they lost half of their effective
strength in their attempts to do so. On April 1st the British, supported
by the French, counter-attacked in the woods north of Moreuil.</p>

<p>On April 4th, a violent German effort on the left bank of the Avre,
against the 36th Corps, was twice checked, but the enemy finally
succeeded, at very heavy cost, in capturing Mailly-Raineval,
Arrière-Cour Wood, Morisel and Castel. On April 5, under the command
of General Robillot, the French counter-attacked: the 127th, 166th
and 59th divisions towards Mailly-Raineval, and the 17th division in
the direction of Moreuil. After driving the enemy from Arrière-Cour
Wood, they returned to the outskirts of Mailly-Raineval. In front of
Sauvillers, where the tanks did good work, they advanced along the
plateau. To the west of Castel, in Sénecat Wood, a furious engagement
took place, in the course of which the enemy were driven back with a
loss of 100 prisoners. On April 17, the French attacked from Mailly to
Castel, captured the greater part of Sénecat Wood, gained a footing
in Gros Hêtre Wood, reached the outskirts of Castel&mdash;bristling with
machine-guns&mdash;and on the south attained the heights which dominate
the Avre, after taking over 650 prisoners, including 20 officers.
The same day, a single French battalion thrown against the village
of Castel&mdash;held by five companies of infantry and two companies of
machine-gunners, of the German 389th regiment of shock troops&mdash;advanced
1,400 yards, capturing several redoubts, 254 prisoners (including 10
officers), and 31 machine-guns. On this day also, the tanks played a
great part in the capture of Sénecat Wood. The commanding officer of a
company of tanks personally took over one of the machines, the crew of
which had been put out of action. Making straight for Castel, he swept
the streets of the village with his machine-gun, then returned safely
to the French lines. Another tank, in hot pursuit of a retreating
German battery of 77's, penetrated over 600 yards into the enemy's
lines, where it broke down. The gallant crew thereupon got out their
machine guns and held off the enemy until their ammunition ran out. On
April 24, an enemy attack on Sénecat Wood failed. On May 11, during a
violent attack, the Germans temporarily gained a footing in the woods
to the south-west of Mailly, but counter-attacks drove them out. On
July 12, the French attacked near Castel and to the south-east of

<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>Folleville, with the ruins of its Château
and its church, is one of the most interesting
places in Picardy, for archæologists.
The ruins of the Château (late
14th and early 15th century), situated
on a hill, from which there is a very extensive view, are most imposing.
The corner towers are round; that in the middle of the
northern curtain is over 80 feet high, and is first round, then hexagonal,
and finally twelve-sided. In proportion as it rises, it overhangs
by means of moulded corbels, which bold design gives it a
larger diameter at the top than at the base.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_photo_079.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Folleville Chateau</span></div>
</div>

<p>The castle, which began to fall into ruins in the 17th century, was
further damaged at the time of the Revolution. It is rich in historical
memories. In 1440, it was taken
by the English, under Counts
Somerset and Talbot, and served
for a long time as their headquarters.
Under Charles IX,
the castle served as a meeting-place
for the Protestants.
Later, the Leaguers had a garrison
there. In February 1592,
Henri IV fought a battle in the
neighbourhood, against the troops
of the Duke of Parma. St.
Vincent-de-Paul lived there as
tutor to M. de Bondi's children,
and it was at Folleville that
he inaugurated the missions
which were the chief aim of the
Congregation founded by him.</p>

</div>

<p>The church (<cite>Hist. Mon.</cite>) standing
near the ruined Château,
comprises a late 14th century
nave and an early 16th century
choir. The latter, intended as a
burial chapel for the owners of
the castle, is the more richly
decorated. Its buttresses are surmounted with pinnacles, on one of which
is a niche containing a statue of the Virgin. The pointed timber-work
vaulting of the nave is among the finest in the <i>Département</i> of the
Somme, and is decorated with satirical and chimerical carvings. The
pulpit is the one from which, on January 25, 1671, St. Vincent-de-Paul
preached the sermon which was the starting-point of his Missions.
The wooden seats in the nave are ancient. The white marble font
is girt with the historical chain of the de Lannoy family, connected
by four shields bearing the arms of Folleville, Lannoy, Broix and
Hangest. It stands on a small pedestal of grey stone, ornamented at
the corners with four carved acanthus leaves. The arches of the
stone vaulting of the choir rest on small brackets carved with various
<i>motifs</i>.</p>

<p>Of the two chapels on either side of the choir, that on the left,
known as the Virgin Chapel, was used by the owners of the castle.
The right-hand one (St. Vincent-de-Paul), is modern in its fittings
and decoration (1868).</p>

<p>The choir contains several very famous monuments, the finest being the
mausoleum of Raoul de Lannoy and Jeanne de Broix; the white marble
sarcophagus is the work of Italian artists (the <i>de Portas</i>); the stone
niche which shelters the sarcophagus contains delicate French carvings.
The whole forms one of the most remarkable works of the Renaissance
period. The neighbouring tomb is that of François de Lannoy and Marie
de Hangest; some of the carvings greatly resemble those of Cardinal
Hémard de Denonville's tomb in the Cathedral of Amiens.</p>

<p>An ancient stained-glass window near the tomb of Raoul de Lannoy
is dedicated to St. Anthony and St. John-the-Evangelist. Above the
door of the sacristy are carved marble medallions. The church used
to possess a very ancient pall, now in the Museum at Amiens.</p>

<p>On March 28, 1918, the first units of the French 166th Division, on
detraining, took up positions along the Coullemelle-Thory line, while
their artillery was posted on the Grivesnes-Coullemelle line. On the
29th, the 4th and 5th battalions of the 350th Regiment, which
had already been fighting the two previous days, occupied Grivesnes,
one of them having lost two-thirds of its effective strength. Reinforced
by a few units of Chasseurs and a company of Engineers, this

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>

handful of men repulsed five successive assaults next day (March
30), after the fall of Malpart.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_084.jpg" alt="Map." />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>On the 31st (Easter Sunday), the enemy attacked with the 1st Division
of the famous Prussian Guards. At 7 a.m., French observers saw the
storm-waves assembling in the shell-holes to the east and north-east
of the park. From 10.30 to 11.30 a.m., the German artillery pounded
the French lines with <i>rafale</i> fire from 6 in. guns. The German
foot-grenadiers advanced by companies, in aligned platoon columns.
The first French line was decimated, and broke under the repeated
onslaughts. The Germans turned the park from the north and east,
and contenting themselves for the time being with surrounding the
castle&mdash;from which a murderous fire was poured on them&mdash;entered the
village.</p>

<p>The commanding officer, who had shut himself up in the castle, was
using a rifle with his men. At noon, he despatched a cyclist with a
report on the situation, to the officer in command of the Divisional
Infantry at Plessier. The report ended with the words: <i>I am in the
castle, and shall hold on till death</i>. The cyclist managed to get
through the German lines, crossed Grivesnes&mdash;already occupied by the
Germans&mdash;and delivered the report. All available units were immediately
got together and despatched to Grivesnes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a reserve battalion at the crossing of the Montdidier
and Plessier roads counter-attacked the German Grenadiers who
were entering the Rue de Montdidier. While the men were clearing
the houses one by one and freeing a number of prisoners, the battalion
commander and his cyclist went forward, with two armoured
cars, the machine-guns of which scattered the German columns. The
Rue de Montdidier was quickly cleared of the enemy and the French
entered the Château. At 2.30 p.m., the detachment from Plessier
arrived, and the German Grenadiers were quickly driven out of the
park. In spite of counter-attacks, the French, with the help of a
battalion from a neighbouring regiment, debouched from Coullemelle
Wood and fully maintained their positions. The Prussian Guard was
thus not only soundly beaten, but also suffered very heavy losses.</p>

<p>The enemy attacked again on April 1 and 3, but without success.
On the 4th, the French 67th Infantry Regiment captured St. Aignan

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>

in the course of a dashing counter-attack, and, in spite of repeated
enemy attempts to reconquer the village, maintained themselves
there. On the 5th the Germans made another powerful but futile
effort against Grivesnes. The 67th Regiment of the line stubbornly
held its own at St. Aignan, while to the east of Grivesnes, the 25th
battalion of Chasseurs repulsed four attacks by two regiments of the
Guard, who were decimated by barrage and machine-gun fire. Later,
the same battalion succeeded in clearing the eastern approaches to
the village. On May 9 the French captured the park, taking 258
prisoners and a large quantity of stores, and beating off all enemy
counter-attacks.</p>

<p><i>Continue along</i> G.C. 26 <i>to</i> <b>Cantigny</b>.</p>

<p>The village and its surroundings were attacked by the Germans at
the end of March 1918. Sharp fighting occurred there on the night
of the 29th and the whole of the following day. Cantigny fell in
the evening of the 30th. On April 4 and 5, a counter-attack in this
region by the French 45th Division, drove back the enemy and gave the
French the northern and western outskirts of the village, which they
were, however, unable to hold. On May 28, the American 1st Division,
supported by a regiment of the French 60th Division and a group of
tanks, brilliantly carried the village and salient of Cantigny along a
2 kms. front, capturing 170 prisoners and a large quantity of stores.</p>

<h2>MONTDIDIER</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Valiant City, martyrised by the War. After sustaining the fire of the
enemy's guns for more than two years, experienced in turn the joys of
deliverance and the horrors of a brutal occupation. An important position,
bitterly disputed, it suffered total destruction, paying with its ruins the
Victory of the Mother-land.</i></p>

<p class="right">
(Croix de Guerre.)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The town stands at the extremity of the Plateau of Santerre, halfway
between Amiens and Compiègne, in the valleys of the Somme
and Oise. Rising in tiers, from south to north, on the limestone cliffs,
its highest point is occupied by the Palais-de-Justice.</p>

<p>The town probably first grew up around a farm in which, according to
tradition, the monks of the Abbey of Corbie kept Didier, King of the
Lombards, whose name was given to the town. The first houses sprang
up in the fertile valley, whilst a <i>castrum</i> was built on the hill.
Owing to its situation on an oft-disputed frontier, Montdidier was
destined to have a stirring history. Of the fortifications which
Philippe-Auguste caused to be erected there, and which were terminated
in 1210, nothing remains but a few fragments of walls covered by the
gardens. At various periods the town was besieged, pillaged and burnt.</p>

<p>Under Charles VIII and Louis XII the walls were rebuilt and the
city's life began anew, only to be disturbed again by war under François
I. After repulsing a band of adventurers in 1522, it was besieged
in 1523 by 30,000 English and Germans, led by the Duke of Norfolk
and Count de Bure. Although a breach was opened in the city's
walls, the burghers refused to capitulate. The place had therefore
to be carried by storm, and the enemy burnt it on October 29.</p>

</div>

<p>After the town had been rebuilt, the Reform quickly gained ground,
in spite of persecutions and the burning of Pastor Michel de la
Grange.</p>

<p>In 1636, a powerful Spanish army, under the command of Jean de
Werth and Piccolomini, captured Roye and summoned Montdidier
to surrender. The burghers refused and, almost unsupported, kept
the enemy at bay and made a number of successful sorties. A narrow
valley on the road to Breteuil has retained the name of "cut-throat",
in remembrance of one of these sorties, during which 200 Spaniards
were slain. After a siege lasting 34 days, the approach of the Royal
Army compelled the Spaniards to retreat, and Louis XIII thanked
the burghers in person for their courage and loyalty.</p>

<p>From that time forward the town lived in peace. Louis XIV often
stayed there on his way to Flanders.</p>

<p>On March 19, 1814, the Cossacks, coming from Roye, entered the
town.</p>

<p>The next day a large detachment of Cossacks and Prussian
Hussars, infantry and artillery, under the Russian Baron de Geismar,
took possession and exacted heavy requisitions in kind.</p>

<p>The Cossacks bivouacked in the streets, with their horses in full
harness, and cooked their food in the open. An attack by the combined
garrisons of Amiens and Beauvais on March 24 drove out the
Cossacks, but the latter returned on the 27th, with the intention of
plundering and burning the town. In response to a petition from the
chief citizens, Baron de Geismar consented not to burn the town, but
allowed his soldiers to pillage it for one hour. On the 28th, the
Cossacks withdrew towards Compiègne, to join the Allies in their march
on Paris.</p>

<p>After Easter, the Prussians held the garrison at Montdidier and in 1815
a Prussian garrison occupied the town for three months.</p>

<p>On October 15, 1870, the Prussians again appeared before Montdidier,
held only by a few regular troops and some National Guards.</p>

<p>After a short bombardment, which caused the death of several
citizens, the Prussians entered the town.</p>

<h3>MONTDIDIER IN 1918.</h3>

<p>Of Montdidier, hardly anything remains but ruins, caused by the
terrible battles fought around the town in March-August 1918.</p>

<p>From the end of Rue du Collège, there is a fine view of the whole
battlefield: Mesnil-St-Georges and Fontaine-sous-Montdidier <i>to the
west</i>; Courtemanche and Framicourt <i>to the north-west</i>; Gratibus,
Pierrepont and Contoire <i>to the north</i>, and Ayencourt and Monchel <i>to
the south</i>.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3>The German offensive&mdash;March 27.</h3>

<p>On March 27, the German hordes were held on the French right, but
overran the plain on the left, where the lack of natural defences made
resistance more difficult. The front-line there was very thin, and the
Germans captured Cessier and Tilloloy.</p>

<p>The French 22nd I.D. fell back on Bus, then lost this village and
the neighbouring woods. For two hours, the enemy were unable to
debouch, being held in check mainly by the fire of batteries in
Marotin Wood. Near by, the 22nd Territorials, with a squadron
of divisional artillery and two companies of engineers, were thrown
into the battle. Fighting stubbornly against odds of ten to one, they
retreated only step by step. The Germans advanced only with very
heavy loss, and they had scarcely entered Marotin Wood when a
concentration of artillery fire scattered them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Held before the <i>massif</i> of Boulogne-la-Grasse, they wedged themselves
in between the latter and Montdidier. There was a gap here between the
left of Humbert's Army and Debeney's right, then being brought up,
and of which only a part, i. e. the 56th Division (Demetz) had taken
up its positions. This division, with the 5th Cavalry Division (De la
Tour) and two battalions of the 97th Territorials, had to defend a
twelve-mile front, extending from Pierrepont to the outskirts of Roye.
Attacks by three German Divisions, supported by a powerful artillery,
were repulsed.</p>

<p>Throughout the morning, the 69th Battalion of Chasseurs fought
along the Echelle-St.-Aurin-Dancourt-Grivillers line. The latter village
only fell at 12.45 p.m.</p>

<p>After the capture of Erches and Saulchoy the 65th Battalion of
Chasseurs held the enemy in check for some time on the Guerbigny
line, but on being attacked on the flank by enemy forces which had
crossed the Avre beyond Guerbigny, they were compelled to fall back,
but only after inflicting very heavy losses on the enemy. This
withdrawal brought about that of the 49th Battalion, above Becquigny.</p>

<p>Before Marquivillers, two battalions of the 105th line Regt. held
their ground for a long time, and withdrew only after being overwhelmed.
Fighting rearguard actions, they fell back on the crest south of
Lignières, then to the plateau east of Etelfay. A battalion of the
132nd line Regt., which had been unable to reach Fescamps, fought
with the Territorials of the 97th between Piennes and Forestil
Farm. At 3 p.m., a battalion of the 132nd was thrown against
Etelfay which had been captured by the Germans, thus enabling two
battalions of the 106th and one of the 132nd to reform on the plateau
to the west, where they kept the enemy in check until 6.30 p.m.</p>

<p>South of Montdidier, the enemy advanced rapidly towards Rollot
and Rubescourt.</p>

<p>The defence of Montdidier was abandoned, and the enemy entered
the town at 6.30 p.m. The 56th I.D. and the 5th Cav. Div. reformed
to the west of Montdidier and the Avre, without losing a single gun.</p>

<h3>The Enemy's Advance held.</h3>

<p>In the evening, the French held the line: Ayencourt,
Mesnil-St.-Georges, Gratibus, Pierrepont and Contoire. General de
Mitry (6th Corps) gave orders to hold at all costs the line of hills
which dominate the Three-Doms stream on the west, between Pierrepont
and Domfront. The 56th Div. defended the line Framicourt, north of
Courtemanche and Domfront.</p>

<h3>March 28.</h3>

<p>On the morning of the 28th, the German 9th Div. entered Courtemanche,
Framicourt and Fontaine-sous-Montdidier, scattered the
units of Engineers who were holding the road to Mesnil, then occupied
Mesnil, Ayencourt and Monchel.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_map_094.jpg" alt="Map of Montdidier area." />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
</div>

<p>The 56th Div. immediately
counter-attacked. While a battalion
of the 132nd Regt.
recaptured Fontaine-sous-Montdidier,
and the 65th Batn. of
Chasseurs advanced in the wood
and on the hill near Mesnil, the
3rd Batn. of the 132nd, supported
by a Batn. of the 350th, drove
back the enemy to Mesnil and
Monchel, and carried these
villages. On the right, General
Humbert's Army recaptured
Assainvillers.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3>March 29.</h3>

<p>On the 29th, the 56th Div.
received orders to advance as
far as the railway, between Courtemanche
and Monchel. The attack was launched at 6 p.m., at the
very moment chosen by the enemy for their own attack. The fighting
at once became very desperate. On the left, a company of the 69th
Batn. of Chasseurs succeeded in entering Framicourt, but was overwhelmed
and partly taken prisoners. The 49th Batn. of Chasseurs, after
advancing as far as the Chapelle de St. Pierre, west of Courtemanche,
was outflanked and forced to withdraw beyond Fontaine-sous-Montdidier.
The 65th Batn. of Chasseurs and the 3rd Batn. of the 132nd Regt.
progressed to the east of Mesnil, as far as Hill 97, but were decimated
by a violent artillery and machine-gun barrage, and had to fall back.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<h3>March 30.</h3>

<p>At dawn, on the 30th, after a violent artillery preparation,
a fresh German attack was launched. To the north, in front of
Fontaine-sous-Montdidier and Hill 104, the 49th Batn. of Chasseurs,
supported by units of the 54th Regt., repulsed seven assaults.</p>

<p>Two German air-squadrons having swept the French lines with
machine-gun fire, the attack was renewed with fresh troops, but
without result. At 3.45 p.m., a new attack by strong enemy columns
succeeded in turning the exhausted French forces on both flanks.
To avoid being surrounded, the French fell back on the crest east
of Villers-Tournelle, and clung desperately to their new positions.
On that day, they threw over 1,500 grenades and fired over
50,000 cartridges. From Mesnil to Royaucourt, the battle was
equally desperate. The German 9th Division had orders to push forward
as far as Elevation 136, i. e. 2½ kms. south-west of Royaucourt.</p>

<p>In front of Mesnil, the French 106th Regt. broke four attacks in
the morning, but at about 5 p.m., the French left having given
way under a terrific bombardment, the Germans reached the northern

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

outskirts of the village. The French only abandoned the village, in
flames, at 6.30 p.m., taking up fresh positions 200-300 yards in
the rear.</p>

</div>

<p>On the right, the Germans took Monchel and Ayencourt, but were
unable to debouch, which prevented them from reaching the south-western
outskirts of Mesnil and the approaches to Royaucourt.</p>

<p>At 7 p.m., a counter-attack by units of the 153rd Regt., a batn.
of cavalry on foot, a section of armoured-cars, and a group of
artillery took the enemy by surprise. Ayencourt and Monchel were
recaptured, and the French line advanced from Monchel to Hill 98.</p>

<p>Exhausted by their efforts and heavy losses, the enemy now
consolidated their slight gains.</p>

<p>The French 56th Div. had fought unceasingly for five days and
lost the greater part of its effective strength, but had fixed the enemy.</p>

<h3>The Liberation on Montdidier. (<i>August 8-10, 1918.</i>).</h3>

<p>During the following months the enemy remained on their positions,
the sector being disturbed only by local attacks and raids on
either side. In the region of Mesnil-St.-Georges, held mainly by the
60th Div., the extreme German right broke down during the offensive
of June 9 against the resistance of the French. In front of a single
company of the 248th line Regiment, over 200 German dead were
counted.</p>

<p>On August 1, the enemy made many unsuccessful efforts in the
neighbourhood of Mesnil. From August 3, the French progressed slowly to
the east of the village, and prepared starting positions for Debeney's
offensive of August 8. On the 4th the Germans, sensing the coming
attack, abandoned part of their positions. The French occupied Braches,
gained a footing in Hargicourt, and reached Courtemanche.</p>

<p>On August 8, the 3rd Div. of the 9th Corps crossed the Avre to the
north, captured and enlarged the bridgehead of Neuville-Sire-Bernard

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>

and occupied the western outskirts of Contoire and Hamel. The 9th Corps
was then replaced by the 10th, the three divisions of which were in
the line: the 152nd and 166th behind the Doms stream, and the 60th in
front of Montdidier. On the morning of the 9th the 152nd Div., instead
of attempting to cross the marshy stream, inclined to the left, crossed
at Neuville-Sire-Bernard, and thus enabled the 166th Div. to force the
passage by a frontal attack opposite Gratibus. While the 126th and
153rd Div. carried Hangest village and plateau, the 152nd Div. advanced
to Contoire and Pierrepont. The 166th Div., which had met with great
difficulty in crossing the Doms stream, was unable to gain a footing
on the plateau to the east. Montdidier, already outflanked from the
north, was now being turned from the south. General Debeney rapidly
transferred his artillery from his left to his right, and began a new
attack. The 60th Div. advanced against Montdidier, and the 169th made
a north-easterly thrust towards Faverolles, to cut the Montdidier-Roye
road, the enemy's main line of retreat. The 133rd Div. attacked
eastwards, to mask the <i>massif</i> of Boulogne-la-Grasse and cover the
flank of the offensive. Behind followed the 46th Div. and 2nd Cavalry
Corps, in readiness to exploit any gains.</p>

</div>

<p>The attack was a complete success. In the evening, from Faverolles
to Piennes, Montdidier was turned from the south. Assainvillers,
Piennes and Faverolles were recaptured, and the enemy fell back
along the Montdidier-Andechy road, which their desperate resistance
before Gratibus had enabled them to keep open. During the night

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>

they evacuated Montdidier in the greatest confusion. While the French
were entering the town, which was entirely in their possession by noon
on the 10th, the whole of Debeney's forces thrust eastwards: the 47th
and 56th Div. advanced to the east of Villers-les-Roye, the 166th
from Gratibus to Lignières, the 60th to the outskirts of Dancourt, the
46th to the east of Tilloloy, the 133rd to the north-east of Fescamps,
and the 169th to before Cessier. Montdidier was now largely cleared.</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO MONTDIDIER.</h3>

<p><i>Abutting on the Esplanade du Prieuré is</i> the <span class="smcap">Benedictines'
Priory</span> which, before the war, was a college. <i>Opposite is</i> the
<span class="smcap">Palais-de-Justice</span>. These two buildings suffered severely from
the bombardments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The <b>Palais-de-Justice</b> was built on the site of the old Château
of the Counts of Montdidier. The entrance was all that remained of the
Château at the beginning of the 14th century. The remains of this door
were used in the construction of the building known as the <span class="smcap">Salle du
Roy</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Montdidier.
The Palais-de-Justice.</span>
(1919.)</div>
</div>

<p>The Salle du Roy is built over a vaulted passage, situated opposite
the Esplanade du Prieuré. To the west, an imposing gable rises
above the cliffs, its thick walls reinforced in the centre by an enormous
buttress, at the northern corner by a smaller buttress, and at the
southern corner by an octagonal turret.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_photo_099-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Palais-de-Justice

</div>

<p>The entrance to the Palais-de-Justice is below the vaulted passage.
On the first story, the Entrance Hall and the corridor leading
to the Audience Chamber were decorated with six large Brussels
tapestries, believed to be work of Henry Reydams (17th century). Made
originally for the town of Douai, they were taken from the Château
of Ferrières&mdash;pulled down in 1809&mdash;in the Department of Oise. The
subjects, taken from the Book of Exodus, depicted: <i>The Crossing of
the Red Sea</i>; <i>the Hebrews glorifying God</i>; <i>Gathering Manna</i>; <i>Moses
striking the Rock</i>; <i>Making the Golden Calf</i>; <i>Worshipping the Golden
Calf</i>. The 1st, 3rd and 4th were faithful reproductions of tapestries

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>

in the Cathedral of Chartres, said to have been made after drawings by
Raphael.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Tomb of Raoul de Crépy.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The other public buildings of Montdidier stood in the main road which
divides the town from north to south into two unequal parts. The first
of these was the <b>Church of St. Pierre</b> (<cite>Hist. Mon.</cite>) <i>reached by
passing under the archway of the Palais-de-Justice and following Rue
St. Pierre</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_photo_100-2.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The interior of St. Peter's Church.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Of this church hardly anything remains except the walls and débris.
Portions of the building were 14th century, but most of it dated
from the 16th century. The tower, now in ruins, was added in 1742.
The doorway was the most remarkable part of the building. The
plans were the work of Chaperon (1538), the master-mason of Beauvais
Cathedral. The style is a combination of flamboyant Gothic (central
dividing pillar, archways, springing of the archways, and niches with
socle and canopy at the base of the main pillars), and Renaissance
(voluted niches and trefoiled bell-turrets, at the top of the pillars). At
the top of the accolade-shaped arch was a shield bearing the arms
of France, surrounded by St. Michael's collar, the three crescents

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>

of Henri II, and a monogram combining the "H" of Henri II, the
double "D" of Diane de Poitiers, and the double "C" of Catherine
de Médicis. The side-walls of the church are sustained by buttresses.
In accordance with a custom fairly common in Picardy, each bay of
the side-aisles had its own separate roof forming a right-angle with that
of the great nave. The interior, with its three naves, massive pillars
and low 15th century vaulting&mdash;lower at the choir end than near
the doorway&mdash;appeared somewhat heavy in style.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the left aisle, a reclining statue was said to depict

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>

Count Raoul de Crépy, and to have formed part of the tomb which
the Count had built in the 11th century, while still alive. This statue
escaped destruction during the Revolution, and was deposited in the
church in 1862. As a matter of fact, it probably dates from the 13th
or 14th century, and does not represent Raoul de Crépy.</p>

<p>In the adjoining chapel is a <i>Burial Scene</i> comprising seven figures
grouped around that of Christ. As in the Tomb of St. Germain-les-Fossés
at Amiens, Mary Magdalene occupies the centre of the group,
whereas this place is usually reserved for the Virgin.</p>

<p>The font (probably 11th. century) is the oldest known specimen
of the type used in Picardy between the 11th and 16th centuries. The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>

low, square basin rests on five supports, the principal one being in
the centre, the other four lesser columns at the corners. The columns,
originally in stone, were replaced in the course of time by wooden ones.
A belt ornamented with eight heads of rather primitive design runs
round the basin. The rest of the decoration, much defaced, includes
two entwined heads, grapes, and doves drinking out of a vase.</p>

<p>The tomb, said to be that of Raoul de Crépy, the "Burial Scene"
and the font are believed to lie buried under the débris.</p>

<p>The organ loft, composed of the remains of fine Renaissance wood
carving of uncertain origin, was destroyed.</p>

<p><i>Keep along Rue St. Pierre to Place de la Croix-Bleue, in which stood</i>
the <span class="smcap">Statue of Parmentier</span> (by Malknecht), erected in 1848. Only

potato growing in France, was a native of Montdidier.</p>

<p>At the end of the right aisle is an <i>Entombment</i> (1549-1582), a gift of
the De Baillon family. The Tomb, which was protected during the war,
comprises <i>The Burial Scene</i> and an <i>Ecce Homo</i> at the top of the
arch over the former. The latter group was finished long before the
other one, and is more natural and of finer finish than that of the
Tomb. The figures kneeling at the praying-desks on the front of the
Tomb represent Pierre de Baillon and his wife, Marguerite de la Morlière.
At the other end of the right aisle stood the baptismal font
(1539), mutilated and covered with whitewash in 1870. The church
of La Boissière possesses an identical font dating from the same period,
but much better preserved. The font probably lies buried under
the débris. In the font chapel there is a stone bas-relief (protected
during the war), said to have come from the old church. It was consecrated
to the Virgin, who is seen receiving the benediction of the
Eternal Father. The carvings and inscriptions around the Virgin,
symbolically recalling the principal episodes in her life, are taken from
the Song of Solomon. Unfortunately, this bas-relief was daubed over
in 1870, and some of the carvings, particularly <i>Les trois enfants qui
pissent</i>, were mutilated because of their realism.</p>

<p>The side-aisles were very picturesque with their live gables and five
separate roofs at right-angles to that of the great nave.</p>

<p>The vaulting is said to have been designed by Jean Vaast, one of the
architects of Beauvais Cathedral. The pretty 16th century font
was ornamented with angels' heads and fantastic figures arranged
alternately and linked together by festoons of leaves. The remarkable
churchwardens' bench of carved wood in Renaissance style was
one of the finest in the <i>Département</i> of the Somme. The wood-work
of the pulpit dated from the same period and was in the same style.</p>

<p>The church was almost entirely destroyed in 1918, but a portion of the
doorway and a buttress with a niche still remain. The gables of the
side-aisles, three of which have retained their roofing, are still
standing. The font near the entrance, on the left, is partly hidden
under the débris. The pulpit was destroyed by the falling tower and
vaulting.</p>

<h3>Boulogne-la-Grasse.</h3>

<p>Boulogne-la-Grasse is situated on the top and along the middle
slopes of a kind of small broken <i>massif</i>. Before the War, the
village consisted of a number of independant quarters intersected by
picturesque, winding streets, the whole hidden from view by gardens and
orchards.</p>

<p>The moats surrounding the site of the old fortified Château are still

<p>The telegraph-station, which used to stand on the top of the hill,
to the west of the village, was destroyed by the Prussians in 1814.</p>

<p>From here, there is a fine panorama of the battlefield. On March 27,
1918, the Germans attacked Boulogne and the villages to the east, i.
e. Conchy-les-Pots, Roye-sur-Matz, and Canny-sur-Matz, held by part
of the French 38th Division which had been brought up to reinforce
the 62nd Division, seriously depleted by several days' fighting. The
Germans captured Boulogne and Conchy, but the next day (28th), the
French counter-attacked and retook both villages. Having, after two
unsuccessful assaults, gained a footing in Canny-sur-Matz, the enemy
launched repeated violent counter-attacks against Conchy and Boulogne,
reoccupying the former, but recapturing only part of the latter. On
the 29th, the French progressed beyond Boulogne and again reached the
outskirts of Conchy without, however, being able to capture Canny or
dislodge the Germans from the eastern part of Boulogne. That night,
Boulogne was crushed by the French artillery and made practically
untenable, but on the 30th, the German offensive, debouching from
Conchy, drove back the French who were occupying the <i>massif</i>. During
the following months, the Germans organized a line of support in this
region known as the "Rheinlandstellung". General Humbert's offensive
of August 10, freed the entire <i>massif</i>. The same evening the line
ran through Orvillers, Boulogne-la-Grasse, La Poste, north of Conchy,
through Conchy-les-Pots and the railway-station of Roye-sur-Matz. On
the 11th, in spite of fierce counter-attacks, the French reached the
wood north of La Poste, Hill 81 to the east of Roye-sur-Matz, and
the outskirts of Canny and La Berlière. On the following days, their
advance definitely freed the region. Canny was re-occupied on the 17th.</p>

were in a remarkably good state of preservation. Previous to the
offensives of 1918, the church had been for three years in the firing
line, and was seriously damaged between 1914 and 1917. Its ruin was
completed in 1918. A few fragments of walls belonging to the chevet are
all that remain.</p>

<p>This district suffered severely from the fierce fighting of March-August
1918. On March 30 two German divisions, including one
of the Guard, attacked Orvillers-Sorel, defended by a portion of the
French 38th Div., the 4th Regt. of Zouaves and the 8th Regt. of
Tirailleurs, the heroes of Douaumont, Hurtebise and La Malmaison.
These two regiments, overwhelmed by numbers, were forced to fall
back, but only after desperate fighting. Units of the 4th Regt.
of Zouaves, greatly outnumbered and cut off, fought to the last man.
Others managed to cut their way through, falling back only to reform
and counter-attack, sometimes without an officer. As far as the
northern outskirts of Orvillers, the ground was defended, inch by
inch, and the enemy were unable to enter the village. During the
night, the 4th Regt. of Zouaves reformed in the ruins, and on the
following day (31st) counter-attacked between 1.30 and 2.30 p.m.,
reconquering Epinette Wood and taking a number of prisoners. Until May
3, when they were relieved, they maintained their positions. On April 12
and May 11, the French delivered two local attacks and progressed
to the north-west of Orvillers. On May 12 and 14, a German attack
against the new positions failed with heavy losses. On August 10, the
34th Corps of Humbert's Army cleared Orvillers-Sorel, and captured
the "Gothenstellung", which formed the third main fighting line of
the German defences.</p>

<p>This village is situated on the old Flanders road, formerly used by
the stage-coaches. The latter used to stop at the Post-House, the
old buildings of which were still standing before the War. The church,
heavy in style, probably dates in part from the end of the 16th century.
Only the walls and tower remain.</p>

<p><i>To reach</i> Belloy Plateau, on which violent fighting took place in June
1918, <i>keep straight on the road from Cuvilly to</i> <b>Lataule</b>.</p>

<p>The church of Lataule, although modern, has retained some of the
windows of the 15th century edifice. Opposite, stands the Château,
built at the end of the 17th century, after the Spanish wars. Of the
old Château, destroyed in the 17th century, traces still remain near to
the road.</p>

<p><i>Turn to the right, skirting the park of the Château, to reach</i> <b>Hill
132</b>, on which are a cemetery, an observation-post, and some
trenches.</p>

<p>From there, the view extends over Belloy and Méry to the west,
Cuvilly to the north, Lataule and Lataule Wood to the east, Genlis
Wood to the south, and St. Maur to the south-east. The Germans
gained a footing on this bare plateau on June 10, 1918, capturing the
villages of Lataule, Méry, Belloy, St. Maur and Cuvilly, after a fierce

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>

battle lasting two days, in which they engaged large forces. Méry
especially, was fiercely disputed and changed hands twice that day.
On the following day (11th), the Germans had scarcely installed
themselves on the newly conquered ground, when they were thrown
into confusion and defeated by the sudden counter-attack of a group
of divisions under General Mangin. All available tanks had been
assembled within twelve hours, in support of this counter-attack,
and thanks to their clearly visible line, the French aviators were able,
throughout the battle, to follow the advance of the infantry with
accuracy. The tanks attacked and cut off the villages of Méry and
Belloy, enabling the infantry to capture the entire German garrisons
without striking a blow. On the 12th they reformed, and went
forward again with the infantry, advancing east of Méry and Genlis
Wood, before Belloy, and as far as the outskirts of St. Maur. The
line was advanced 2 kms., east of Méry, as a consequence of this
thrust, and German counter-attacks failed to win back the lost ground.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>

Cuvilly remained in the possession of the enemy, who consolidated it.
On August 10, when the offensive by Humbert's Army began, the
German line of support known as the "Vandalenstellung", which
passed south of the village, was carried by the French in a single rush.</p>

<p>Ressons is a very ancient market-town. St. Amand, bishop of Maestricht,
preached the Gospel there about the year 632. It was formerly a fairly
important place, especially in the 16th century. A fortified castle,
standing at the end of the village on the road to Séchelles, was taken
by the Burgundians in 1430, and afterwards recaptured by the French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The church (<i>Hist. Mon.</i>) dates from various periods: the nave and
side-aisle with their richly ornamented buttresses were rebuilt in the
middle of the 16th century; the most ancient parts (cornices of the
nave, and the northern transept and choir) are 12th century; fragments
of the stained-glass windows bear the date "1561". The building was
considerably damaged in 1918: the stained-glass windows were destroyed
and the bell disappeared.</p>

<p>The church is mainly 16th century. The choir vaulting contains several

there a fine panoramic view may be had of the battlefield on both sides
of the Amiens-Compiègne road, as far as the Aronde, particularly to
the south-west, where the view takes in Antheuil, Loges Farm (an old
dependency of Ourscamps Abbey), and Porte Farm, formerly belonging to
Élincourt-St.-Marguerite Priory. This region was the scene of desperate
fighting during the German offensive of June 9-11, 1918.</p>

</div>

<p>On the night of the 10th, the Germans captured Antheuil and the
two farms, advancing as far as the Aronde. They were already
shouting victory, in the belief they were outflanking Compiègne from
the north-west and would soon reach Estrées-St.-Denis, when the
counter-attack of June 11 drove them back. Antheuil was retaken and
held; the two farms were likewise recaptured, but the French were
unable to hold them.</p>

<p>On the 14th, although the enemy failed in front of Antheuil,
they resumed their advance towards Les Loges and Porte Farm.</p>

<p>During the rest of the month this sector remained agitated. On several
occasions the Germans attempted
to retake Antheuil,
but were each time repulsed.</p>

<p>A surprise attack by the
French on July 9 resulted in
the capture of the two farms
in the early morning, with
500 prisoners. On the 13th,
they improved their positions
and advanced 500 yards
to the north of Porte Farm.
On August 10, the whole
district was cleared by the
advance of Humbert's Army.</p>

The Church.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This is a very old village, in the neighbourhood of which are several
tombs dating from a very remote period. The country was occupied
by the Romans. Gallo-Roman remains have been discovered around
the Château of Bellinglise. Under Charles-le-Simple, the village and
chapel of St. Marguerite were given to the Abbey of St. Corneille at
Compiègne. The Priory of St. Marguerite, founded by the Benedictines
at the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century, was
rebuilt in the 13th century. The district hereabouts suffered severely
during the Hundred Years War. According to a local tradition,
the old Château of Beauvoir, on the left of the Thiescourt road and
now entirely overrun with vegetation, gave shelter one night to Joan
of Arc, then a prisoner. This is not improbable, but the tablet in
the church, bearing the following inscription: <i>Joan of Arc, before
shutting herself up in Compiègne, in MCCCCXXX, made a pilgrimage
to St. Marguerite and communicated in the church of Élincourt</i>, is not
borne out by history, as she could not have gone to Élincourt&mdash;occupied
by the English&mdash;seeing that she left Crépy to go to Compiègne.</p>

<p>Parts of the church are early 12th century, the aisles and belfry
18th. The doorway includes three accoladed windows, with two
other windows above surmounted by diamond-pointed moulding.
In the interior, there is an 18th century marble altar. A marble statue
of St. Marguerite was placed in safety during the war, but another
of St. John (15th century) also in marble, has disappeared, together
with the two shrines of St. Barbe and St. Marguerite.</p>

<p>The church was seriously damaged, most of the vaulting being
destroyed. At the eastern termination, the partial collapse of two

ornamented the choir and which were walled in at the time the buttresses

<p><i>Leaving the church on the left, follow the road as far as the first
crossing. Leave the car and climb the hill-side on foot, as far as</i> the
<b>Monastery of St. Marguerite</b>, which dominates the whole valley
of the Matz, and from which there is a fine view extending from
Ressons Wood to the Soissonnais hills. Only fragments of the
surrounding walls, a deep well, some cellars (which were transformed
into shelters), and a number of old yew-trees remain.</p>

Gallo-Roman mound, to the north of the Priory Garden. The great hall
has low vaulting, the central springing of which rests on a round
pillar; the keystones represent three entwined fishes. The <b>Château
of Bellinglise</b>, abutting on Marfontaine Manor, was built in the
16th century.</p>

<p>During the battle of March 30, 1918, the headquarters of General
d'Ambly (77th Division) were at Élincourt, while those of General
Guillemin (53rd Division) were at Chevincourt. At that time, these
divisions were barring the road from Plessis-de-Roye to the Oise. Until
June 9, the enemy attempted local operations only. On June 9, they
attacked in massed formation, capturing Gury Heights, Ricquebourg
Wood, and Mareuil-la-Motte. The village of Ressons-sur-Matz, in which
they gained a footing, was disputed foot by foot. St. Claude Farm,
which also fell, was in the thick of the battle. It was an important
position overlooking the plateau, from which the enemy, from the
outset of the attack, had an extensive view over a large part of the
French rear positions, and its loss meant the withdrawal of the artillery.
The brunt of the German attack was directed against this observation-post,
which had to be abandoned, the French being overwhelmed.
On the 10th the Germans reached Ressons Wood and Bellinglise
Plateau, gained a footing in Marquéglise, and captured the farms of
Attiche, Monolithe, Ribécourt and Antoval. On the 12th, after repeated
attempts, they gained a footing in Mélicocq, carried the heights of
Croix-Ricard, and crossed the Matz. However, on June 13, a French
counter-attack drove them back across the river; Mélicocq and Croix-Ricard
were recaptured, together with a hundred prisoners and a number
of guns. In spite of several violent counter-attacks, the enemy were held.</p>

<p>On August 10, an offensive by Humbert's Army began to clear
the whole region. At 4.20 a.m., the 129th, 165th, 6th, 121st, 74th,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>

123rd, 67th, 38th and 15th Divs. attacked from Courcelles to
Antheuil and from Antheuil to the Oise. At 7 a.m. the first
objectives were reached. Ressons, through which ran the enemy's main
line (the "Gothenstellung") was passed, whilst Marquéglise, the Château
of Séchelles, Chevincourt and Bourmont were captured. The
whole of a Regimental Staff was captured at the Château of Séchelles.
At Ressons the tanks threw the Germans into confusion. On the
11th, Vignemont, Margny, Le Plessier, Hill 179, Mareuil-la-Motte,
Bellinglise Château and Élincourt were captured. The French advanced
in the direction of Gury and St. Claude Farm, which formed the key
of the "Gothenstellung" position, and by evening had reached the
western outskirts of Gury, a point south of La Berlière and Hill
143, and approached St. Claude Farm, Hill 166, Samson, Cense
Farm and the quarries of Montigny and Antoval. On the 12th,
they captured and progressed beyond Gury and St. Claude Farm,
and took Écouvillon and Loges Wood, the latter being, however,
lost again in the afternoon. On the 13th, they advanced along
the plateau, gained a footing in Plessis Park, reached the eastern
outskirts of Belval, and attained a point 800 yards north-east of Gury.
Entering Ribécourt on the 14th, they re-occupied the Attiche and Monolithe
Farms on the 15th, as well as the quarries situated 2 kms.
north-west of Ribécourt. On the 17th, the Germans delivered several
powerful attacks near Monolithe and Attiche Farms, but failed to
drive back the French, who strongly held the newly conquered ground.</p>

<p><i>From St. Claude Farm, return to Élincourt. Near the church, take Rue
de l'Escalier</i> (G.C. 142) <i>and the road on the left of the Calvary.
1 km. further on, near a block of houses, follow the right-hand
road, passing through</i> <b>Marest-sur-Matz</b>. <i>The road skirts the</i>
<span class="smcap">Chateau of Rimberlieu</span>, <i>opposite which is</i> a tower&mdash;all that
remains of an old fortified castle. <b>Villers-sur-Coudun</b> <i>is next
reached</i>, whose church is situated on the left, near the end of the
village. The end of the chancel is 12th-13th century, the façade and
vaulting 15th-16th century, the remainder modern.</p>

<p><i>Continue along the road to</i> <b>Coudun</b>, formerly the Head-Quarters
of the Training Camp built in 1698 for the Duke of Burgundy, grandson
of Louis XIV. The king, accompanied by James II of England, paid a
visit to this camp in August, to attend the military man&#339;uvres. The
camp, under the command of Marshal de Boufflers, extended along the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>

plateau which dominates the right bank of the Oise from Lachelle to
Margny and from Baugy to the Château of Bienville. 50 battalions of
Infantry, 52 squadrons of Cavalry and 40 guns were stationed there.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Villers-sur-Coudun.&mdash;The Main Street.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Although the nave and aisles of <span class="smcap">St.
Hilaire Church</span> are modern, the façade,
arched doorway and choir date from the
Norman period (11th or 12th century). The
doorway is ornamented with an archivolt
formed by raftered and counter-raftered
<i>tori</i> with a tympanum of diamond-moulding.
One of the cornices of the choir is supported
by Norman arcading with figured modillions.
Inside the church are a stoup and
a 7-branched chandelier (both made out of
a single piece of wrought-iron), and a 17th
century painting above the high altar depicting:
<i>The Crowning of the Virgin</i>. The
bronze bell (761) was saved.</p>

<p><i>Keep along G.C. 142</i> to <b>Bienville</b>, situated to the west of a
long hill&mdash;the Ganelon&mdash;which stretches from the south-east to the
north-west, and whose south-western side is sharply indented. From
the top of this hill (altitude: 480 feet) consisting of a plateau
which dips slightly down towards the Oise, there is a fine view over
the whole of the surrounding country: Laigue Forest, Aisne Valley,
Compiègne Forest, Oise Valley as far as Verberie, and the hills of
Liancourt, between Creil and Clermont. At the north-western end of
Ganelon Hill, many Roman medals and antiquities have been discovered,
and it is believed that a Roman camp formerly occupied this site.
Tradition has it that a fortified castle stood there in the Middle-Ages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Great War broke out, Michelin at once converted
an immense new four-storied warehouse into an up-to-date
Hospital, with Operating Theatre, X-Ray, Bacteriological
Laboratory, etc. Seven weeks later (September 22, 1914)
Doctors, Dispensers, Nurses, Sisters of Mercy, and auxiliaries
were all at their posts. The first wounded arrived the same
night. In all, 2,993 wounded were received.</p>

<p>All expenses were paid by Michelin.</p>

<p>The story of how Michelin did "his bit" during the war
is told briefly and simply in the illustrated booklet, "The
Michelin Hospital", sent post free on application.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
